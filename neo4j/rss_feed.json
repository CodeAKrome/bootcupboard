It should contribute positively to world peace and stability, instead of merely being a troublemaker,\" Zhang told the Security Council briefing on Ukraine.\"I would like to point out that NATO, on the one hand, claims to remain a regional defensive alliance, while on the other hand, constantly seeks to breach its geographic confines and expand its agenda, stoke division and tensions, create fears and confrontations, and keep strengthening military and security ties with Asia Pacific countries,\" said the ambassador.\"This is obviously self-contradictory. We note with concern that the NATO secretary general recently made many irresponsible and unfounded remarks on the situation of Asia Pacific,\" Zhang explained.The envoy stressed that the Ukraine crisis is, in essence, the culmination of security conflicts in Europe closely related to NATO's constant eastern expansion since the Cold War.\"Pursuing absolute security and political exclusion and containment by force against a specific party is the very crux of the reason why Europe is in the security plight.

It is the modernization of a huge population, of common prosperity for all, of material and cultural-ethical advancement, of harmony between humanity and nature, and of peaceful development.Xi said Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that \"modernization is equal to Westernization,\" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity.Advancing Chinese modernization is a systematic endeavor, Xi stressed, adding that it is also an exploratory undertaking.Once the strategy is formulated, it must be adhered to over the long term, he said, adding that the right direction of Chinese modernization must be ensured.Xi said innovation must be placed in a prominent position in overall national development, and efforts must be made to achieve higher efficiency than capitalism while maintaining fairness in the society more effectively.He also demanded more efforts to expand high-standard opening up and deeply involve the country in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation.\"The cause of promoting Chinese modernization, which is an unprecedented and pioneering venture, will inevitably encounter all kinds of risks, challenges, difficulties and even dangerous storms, some of which we can foresee and others we cannot,\" Xi said. \"Let us harness our indomitable fighting spirit to open new horizons for our cause.\"Xi stressed the importance of the work during this year in advancing Chinese modernization. The decisions and plans made by the CPC Central Committee must be fully implemented and efforts must be made to achieve an overall improvement in the economy, he said.Presiding over the opening of the session, Li Qiang said that the important speech delivered by Xi enriched and developed the theory of Chinese modernization and should be carefully studied and grasped. He called for thinking and acting in line with the guiding principles of the speech.Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, addresses the opening of a study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance) on Feb. 7, 2023.

In the south Lebanese city of Tyre about an hour and a half drive from here lies the barrack of the Chinese peacekeeping contingent. Since China\u2019s first batch of peacekeeping contingent deployed to Lebanon in 2006, the Chinese peacekeepers have successfully completed all tasks assigned by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), serving to fulfill peacekeeping missions, passing on peace and friendship, and winning high acclaim from the UNIFIL headquarters, the Lebanese government and the local people.\"There must be someone to undertake the task no matter how dangerous it is\"The area adjacent to the Blue Line, the border demarcation between Lebanon and Israel, is mountainous, covered with dense vegetation and with a distant seascape at sight. In the dense forest, thousands of minefields are scattered and hundreds of thousands of mines are buried. One of the main tasks of the 21st Chinese peacekeeping multi-role engineer detachment to Lebanon is to clear mines and dispose of explosive ordnance therein. Wearing protective clothing and testing the mine detector, Chen Qian, a mine-sweeping operator, and his comrades-in-arms, stepped into a minefield through a safe passage surrounded by barbed wires and began the day's work. Since arriving in Lebanon to carry out demining missions, Chen Qian has safely cleared more than 50 landmines. \"When I dug the first mine here, I was very nervous, having my heart in my mouth.\" It was summer at that time, and Chen\u2019s heavy protective gears got soaked in less than a minute; however, he had to take over 20 minutes to get a mine dug out after confirming its location. \"At the moment when I saw the mine detonated, I was very excited and also had a sense of achievement. No matter how dangerous mine-sweeping task is, there must be someone to undertake it. I have determined to accomplish tasks assigned and fulfill responsibilities,\" he said. On the site, he insisted on carefully disposing of it in accordance with standard operating procedures, though he has been quite familiar with the minefield in front. Pulling the cordon, he began to trim the bushes nearby, starting from the top of the bush and cutting only 20 cm at a time. \"The minefield was laid in the 1970s. Due to vegetation growth, rain erosion and other reasons, many mines have been displaced, wrapped up in tree roots or hidden in the grass. Outside the cordon, no one knows where mines are exactly, and we can't afford to make the slightest mistake,\" he introduced, methodically carrying out a series of operations, including signal source positioning, comprehensive excavation, and mine marking. With the issuance of the detonation order, all four mines cleared on the same day were destroyed. Since deployed to the mission area in August 2022, the 21st Chinese peacekeeping multi-role engineer detachment to Lebanon has obtained the mine clearance and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) qualifications awarded by the UN in the shortest possible time, having cleared minefields of more than 3,700 square meters with more than 850 mines disposed of. \"The Chinese mine-sweeping operators are not afraid of danger and difficulties, and have always maintained a record of \u2018zero accident\u2019 and zero \u2018casualties\u2019, making outstanding contributions to maintaining the peace and stability in the southern Lebanon region,\" said Major General Aroldo L\u00e1zaro S\u00e1enz, Head of Mission and Force Commander of the UNIFIL.\"Showing the demeanor of Chinese servicemen\"Going abroad, peacekeeping contingents serve as a representative of the image of China. They have to complete various tasks assigned while involved in or carrying out various activities for exchanges, with a view to displaying the demeanor of the Chinese servicemen and enhancing friendship and mutual trust with their counterparts.Composing Chinese Spring Festival couplets, making paper-cuts for window decoration, and wrapping dumplings, Brigadier General Bruno Helluy, chief of staff of UNIFIL, and his entourage came to the Chinese camp to pay New Year's greetings to the peacekeepers on the eve of Spring Festival, and celebrate the arrival of the Chinese New Year of the Rabbit with them on the spot. After watching the performances like the dragon dance, lion dance and tea art show, Tian Yuan, deputy head of the foreign affairs unit of the multi-role engineer detachment, introduced the origin and some customs of the Spring Festival to Brigadier General Bruno. \"I'm glad to experience the Chinese New Year in person on the spot,\" said Brigadier General Bruno. \"People from different countries gather here to exchange and learn from each other. We also have an even deeper understanding of the Chinese culture.\"The Chinese peacekeeping contingent and its Cambodian counterpart are the only two UNIFIL troops with mine clearance and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) qualifications at present. For a long time, the two sides have carried out exchanges focusing on subjects including the implementation of peacekeeping missions, troop building, emergency defense, and safe and efficient mine clearance, and have visited the minefields of the other side from time to time for field research and study. On January 23, the Cambodian peacekeepers visited the camp of the Chinese peacekeeping contingent to try on the Chinese protective gears, experience mine detectors, and exchange experience in mine clearance and EOD. \"We are very pleased to come to the Chinese peacekeeping camp for exchanges during the Spring Festival. Many thanks to the Chinese peacekeeping contingents for back-up to us,\" said Zhai Xishuo, commander of the Cambodian peacekeeping contingent, after the event.Since arriving in the mission area, the multi-role engineer detachment has completed various forms of China-foreign military exchanges and joint exercises and training with excellence such as the Iron Storm multinational exercise and the Angel Rescue exercise. At the same time, it has vigorously carried out cultural exchanges with nearby villages, schools and friendly forces, held other activities like \"Chinese Culture Festival\", displaying the image and quality of the Chinese service members, and making friends with the UNIFIL friendly forces and the local people.\"Feeling the love of Chinese military doctors as relatives\"In addition to the multi-role engineer detachment, the 21st Chinese peacekeeping contingent to Lebanon also includes the construction engineer detachment and the medical detachment. The two detachments deployed at different localities in the peacekeeping mission area in southern Lebanon are responsible for many tasks such as engineering construction and construction, medical aid and humanitarian relief.Since August in 2022, the engineer detachment has completed more than 30 construction tasks with high standards, including the fortification renovation for the UNIFIL headquarters, the fence renovation in the Nepalese camp, and the lifting and replacement of the generator set in the Malaysian camp, acting as a strong back-up force to its foreign counterparts.From hand debridement and suture to elbow abscess removal, from refugee rescue to medicine donation, the medical detachment has provided humanitarian medical assistance such as emergency treatment and free clinics to the local people within its own capability, while providing high-quality and efficient medical support for more than 4,000 peacekeepers and employees therein.Thirteen-year-old Abeid left Syria for Lebanon with his parents to avoid war and has been living in a village on the Lebanese-Israeli border. He got injured in a motorcycle collision when going out. Abeid's father turned to the Chinese military hospital with the medical contingent for help after his initial diagnosis and treatment in a local hospital, because he could not afford the high follow-up diagnosis and treatment expenses. After an over-10-day treatment, Abeid recovered step by step. The members of the medical detachment also sent yogurt, biscuits, bread, bedding, etc. on a special trip after learning about the miserable life of Abeid\u2019s family. \"War has displaced us and deprived us of our beloved ones, but we have felt the love of Chinese doctors like relatives. Thank you,\" said Abeid's father.Since 2006, China has dispatched more than 7,000 peacekeepers to Lebanon, removed more than 15,000 mines and unexploded ordnance of various kinds, and provided medical assistance to more than 87,000 local residents, having effectively promoted the realization of UNIFIL's peacekeeping objectives. As highlighted by Aroldo L\u00e1zaro S\u00e1enz, Head of Mission and Force Commander of the UNIFIL, China has played an important role in safeguarding world peace, and he would like to extend gratitude to China for its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping cause in Lebanon.\"Going abroad to participate in international peacekeeping operations, I have felt a great sense of responsibility and viewed it as a glorious mission,\" said Yan Xiaoliang, commanding officer of the 21st Chinese peacekeeping contingent to Lebanon. \u201cChinese people love peace and know the value of peace. We will continue to faithfully perform the peacekeeping mission, resolutely complete the peacekeeping missions assigned, make positive contributions to safeguarding lasting peace in southern Lebanon, and safeguarding peace with practical actions.\"Editor's note: Originally published on people\u2019s.com.cn, this article is translated from Chinese into English and edited by the China Military Online.\u00a0", "media_content": [], "media_thumbnail": []}

Family gatherings are the most joyful occasions, and reunions are the happiest, he said at the 2018 Spring Festival gathering held by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has proven time and again that statement himself, and has long been making time for family on special occasions despite his tight schedule.In 2001, Xi, then governor of east China's Fujian Province, wrote his father Xi Zhongxun a heartfelt letter after missing the family celebration for his 88th birthday.Xi would spend time with his mother whenever he was available, having dinner, taking a walk, or chatting.Xi's wife Peng Liyuan, a celebrated singer, used to perform at the annual Spring Festival gala broadcast nationwide on the eve of the holiday in Beijing. So when he worked in the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, as long as Xi had time to spend the Spring Festival with his family in Beijing, he would make dumplings at home while watching the gala and waiting until Peng finished her work. The family would boil the dumplings when Peng was home and have their festival dinner together.These dumplings by Xi, as well as the best wishes for an auspicious future that they symbolize, have also been shared by others.Since assuming the Party's top job in November 2012, Xi has always taken time to join the family reunions of local people, those in difficulties in particular, extending his festive greetings and learning about their difficulties ahead of the Spring Festival.Ahead of the Spring Festival in 2019, Xi toured a \"hutong,\" or a traditional alley, in central Beijing's Qianmen area. He visited two courtyard homes in the hutong, including the home of retired worker Zhu Maojin, then 72. Xi gladly chatted with locals and made dumplings with them, asking about the improvements to their living conditions after a renovation project in their neighborhood and their festival purchases.\"As per tradition in Beijing, we used to go to fairs days before the festival. We don't have such markets in the city now, but we still go to the supermarkets to buy things and cook food at home for the Lunar New Year,\" Zhu said.Dumplings and other foods are not only a matter of diet for Xi, as he understands they are related to people's well-being. Behind the idea of a family reunion is love. \"Never let long distances sever family ties, and never forget loving or expressing love, no matter how busy you are,\" Xi said at the 2017 Spring Festival gathering.Xi advocates combining the love for family with love for the country so that every individual and family can contribute to the big family of the Chinese nation.\"What the Party pursues is to make the people's lives better,\" he once said.\u00a0", "media_content": [], "media_thumbnail": []}

China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter, has been firmly supporting the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law, and helping build a more peaceful and better world with its wisdom and solutions.KEY FORCE FOR WORLD PEACEFounded at the end of World War II, the United Nations bears the expectation of all for permanent peace. Sharing its vision of maintaining peace and stability, China believes that peace is the most precious, and has practiced \"harmony without uniformity\" since antiquity.Since the founding of the United Nations, China has actively participated in the political settlement of major regional hotspot issues, including the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the Palestine-Israel issue.It has been upholding the authority and unity of the UN Security Council, and supporting UN mediation in accordance with its mandate. It has also played an active role in the international arms control and disarmament process, and has acceded to dozens of international arms control treaties and mechanisms, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.In response to mounting conflicts and security challenges in today's world, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2022.The GSI has won wide recognition from the international community, including the United Nations. The initiative advocates that humanity is an indivisible security community. It offers Chinese wisdom to bridge the peace deficit of mankind, and contributes Chinese solutions to address global security challenges.Regarding the ongoing Ukraine crisis, China decides its position and policy based on the merits of the matter concerned, upholds objectivity and fairness, and actively promotes peace talks.\"China's idea of being a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods are consistent with the ideals of the UN Charter,\" former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said.ENGINE OF GLOBAL GROWTH\"Facing the severe shocks of COVID-19, we need to work together to steer global development toward a new stage of balanced, coordinated and inclusive growth. To this end, I would like to propose a Global Development Initiative (GDI),\" Xi put forward this idea for the first time at the general debate of the 76th session of the UNGA in September 2021.The initiative aims to stay committed to development as a priority, to a people-centered approach, to benefits for all, to innovation-driven development, to harmony between man and nature and to results-oriented actions.The GDI has yielded preliminary results. To date, more than 100 countries and a number of international organizations, including the United Nations, have committed support to the GDI, and close to 70 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI.A Global Development Promotion Center was created, with 31 countries and regional organizations joining its network. A Global Development Project Pool was set up, with the first list of 50 projects launched. A total of 1,000 human resources training programs have been conducted, including more than 50 member countries of the Group of Friends of the GDI.Meanwhile, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has become a popular international platform to promote the public good and cooperation since it was proposed 10 years ago, covering two thirds of countries and a third of international organizations in the world.China's development and contributions will benefit many countries as the world's population exceeds 8 billion, said Natalia Kanem, executive director of the UN Population Fund.MAKING THE WORLD LESS POOR\"China has met the basic living needs of its 1.3 billion-plus people and lifted over 700 million people out of poverty, which is a significant contribution to the global cause of human rights,\" said Xi in his keynote speech at the UN Office at Geneva in January 2017.In December 2020, China announced that it has accomplished its poverty alleviation target of the new era as scheduled. During eight years of sustained work, China has lifted its entire rural poor population under the current standard out of poverty.Poverty is a chronical problem in human society. China is ready to share its experiences with the rest of the world for the global cause of poverty alleviation.In recent years, China has supported the development of developing countries through \"six 100 projects\" -- 100 poverty reduction projects, 100 agricultural cooperation projects, 100 aid for trade projects, 100 ecological conservation and climate change response projects, 100 hospitals and clinics, and 100 schools and vocational training centers.In Asia, China carried out the East Asia Poverty Reduction Demonstration Cooperation Technical Assistance Projects program in the rural communities of Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.In Africa, China has helped African countries build water conservancy infrastructure, set up demonstration zones for agricultural cooperation, and carried out China-Africa cooperation projects involving a Chinese-invented technology using grass to grow mushrooms.In the South Pacific region, China has carried out technical cooperation assistance projects in infrastructure construction, agriculture and medical care.In Latin America, China has built agricultural technology demonstration centers to help local people in recipient countries shake off poverty.Commenting on China's poverty reduction drive, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said those achievements are \"the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty.\"FIGHTING COVID TOGETHER\"People of different countries have come together. With courage, resolve and compassion which lit the dark hour, we have confronted the disaster head on. The virus will be defeated. Humanity will win this battle,\" Xi said in a statement at the general debate of the 75th session of the UNGA in September 2020, when the world was ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has been sharing with the world its experience in fighting against the virus in a timely manner, assisting other countries with much-needed supplies, and actively engaging in global anti-pandemic cooperation.So far, it has provided anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations, and co-hosted more than 300 exchange activities on epidemic prevention and control and medical treatment with over 180 countries and regions and more than 10 international organizations.China is also the first country to propose COVID-19 vaccines as a global public good, support vaccine intellectual property rights exemption, and champion cooperation on vaccine production with developing countries, which has injected strong impetus into bridging the global immunization gap. Applying Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for the treatment of COVID-19 infections, the country has introduced TCM techniques to more than 150 countries and regions, and offered ready-for-use TCM to those in need.Lauding China's help for developing countries in their fight against the pandemic, Romina Sudack, a member of the Study Group on China and Argentina of the National University of Rosario, said China has been implementing the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind with concrete actions.CHAMPION OF GLOBAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCEChampioning the vision of ecological conservation, China has become a solid contributor to tackling climate change and the betterment of global climate governance.And the Chinese president has on multiple occasions elaborated on China's propositions on jointly building a clean and beautiful world for all countries.\"Clear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver. We must maintain harmony between man and nature and pursue sustainable development,\" Xi said at the UN Office at Geneva in 2017.In the past decade, China made historic contributions to the conclusion and quick implementation of the Paris Agreement, was among the first to adopt and release the country's National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and implement the obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).China also announced 1+N policies for peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality with clear timetables and roadmaps. The country has become a world leading player in renewable energy, and is mounting consistent efforts to tap the potential of a green BRI.As the largest developing country, China is striving to build a community of life for man and nature with unprecedented ambition and action to help achieve sustainable development worldwide.UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell spoke highly of China's firm and consistent stand on actively tackling climate change, as well as its moves to turn climate commitments into concrete actions.At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, Stiell said.\u00a0", "media_content": [], "media_thumbnail": []}
