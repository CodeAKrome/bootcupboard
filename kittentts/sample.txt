Summary of the Ukraine-Russia-U.S.-Europe peace talks (18-19 Aug 2025)

1. Washington summit (18 Aug)
   • First-ever joint White House session between President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and all major European leaders (Macron, Starmer, Merz, Meloni, Stubb, von der Leyen, NATO’s Rutte).  
   • Purpose: prevent a repeat of February’s acrimonious Trump–Zelenskyy encounter and keep Ukraine/Europe in any peace process after Trump’s 15 Aug Alaska meeting with Putin.  
   • Key deliverable: Trump publicly endorsed “NATO-like” security guarantees for Ukraine, coordinated by Europe with U.S. backing, but offered no U.S. troops.  
   • Zelenskyy secured a tentative $90 bn U.S. arms package and agreement to purchase Ukrainian drones; said details of the guarantees would be drafted within 7–10 days.  
   • Europeans pressed for an immediate ceasefire; Trump argued one is not essential before final peace talks. No ceasefire or territorial accord was reached.

2. Putin–Trump phone call (19 Aug)
   • Trump phoned Putin for 40 minutes after the Washington meetings.  
   • Trump announced he had “begun arrangements” for a face-to-face Zelenskyy–Putin meeting (location TBD), followed by a trilateral summit with Trump.  
   • Kremlin aide Ushakov confirmed the call discussed “raising the level” of direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations but stopped short of confirming Putin’s attendance.

3. Outstanding issues
   • Territory: Russia reportedly demands full Ukrainian withdrawal from Donetsk/Luhansk and acceptance of Crimea’s annexation; Zelenskyy reiterates Ukraine’s constitution forbids ceding land.  
   • Security guarantees: still undefined—could mirror NATO Article 5 but without NATO membership; questions remain over enforcement, troop presence, and U.S. commitment.  
   • Ceasefire: Europeans and Zelenskyy want one before deeper talks; Trump and Putin prefer to move straight to a comprehensive peace treaty.

4. Next steps
   • Coalition-of-the-Willing video conference (19 Aug) to flesh out security architecture.  
   • Possible Zelenskyy–Putin meeting in Geneva or another neutral venue within weeks, followed by trilateral session with Trump.  
   • Timeline floated by Trump: “a week or two” to judge whether a deal is achievable.

Bottom line: After years of stalemate, Washington has engineered a fragile diplomatic track that keeps Ukraine and Europe at the table, secures a potential U.S. arms pipeline, and opens the door to direct Zelenskyy–Putin talks—yet leaves the hardest questions (territory, ceasefire, enforcement) unanswered and hinges on Putin’s willingness to engage.
