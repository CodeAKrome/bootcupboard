{'source': 'bbc-top', 'title': 'What might have caused Sicily yacht to sink', 'link': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0nwe4d7k5o', 'tags': [], 'flavor': 'art', 'published': 'Tue, 20 Aug 2024 16:33:21 GMT', 'published_parsed': [2024, 8, 20, 16, 33, 21, 1, 233, 0], 'summary': 'As the rescue operation continues off the Italian coast, questions remain as to why the superyacht sank.', 'media_content': [], 'media_thumbnail': [{'width': '240', 'height': '134', 'url': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/f10c/live/452ea480-5f03-11ef-a305-5b3af7488718.png'}], 'text': 'Specialist divers continue to search for six people who were onboard a luxury superyacht which capsized off the coast of Sicily on Monday morning - but questions have been asked about why the vessel sank. According to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder, the boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on 14 August and and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of "at anchor". It is believed the ship was struck by a tornado over the water - otherwise known as a waterspout - causing Bayesian to capsize. There are separate reports the boat\'s mast snapped during the freak storm and other factors in the boat\'s sinking include water entering through hatches and doors which had been left open because of warm weather off the Italian coast. Witnesses have described seeing a waterspout form during the storm before the sinking of the Bayesian. Most are familiar with what tornadoes look like - they are rotating columns of destructive winds, protruding from the base of clouds down to the ground. According to BBC Weather, waterspouts are just that too, but are over water rather than land.  Instead of dust and debris swirling around the core of strong winds, it is water mist whipped up from the surface. Like tornadoes, most are only short-lived, narrow columns and are not easily picked out on weather radars, so many will go unreported. However, they are not as rare as you may think.  According to the International Centre for Waterspout Research there were 18 confirmed waterspouts off the coast of Italy on 19 August alone. In the northern hemisphere, waterspouts are most common in late summer and through the autumn, when sea temperatures are at their highest, fuelling the storm clouds.  However, with sea temperatures rising due to climate change there is a concern that they could become more common. In the last week, the Mediterranean has registered its highest sea surface temperature on record, which has helped to energise this recent storm outbreak. The Bayesian was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and was last refitted in 2020.  According to Perini\'s website Bayesian has a 75m (246ft) mast which it claims is the tallest aluminium mast in the world. Karsten Borner, the captain of another yacht anchored nearby at the time of the storm, said there was a "very strong hurricane gust" and he had to battle to keep his vessel steady. He saw the Bayesian\'s mast "bend and then snap", according to Italy\'s Corriere della Sera daily newspaper. But, providing an update on the rescue mission, Marco Tilotta, from the Palermo fire service divers\' unit, told AFP the ship was lying on its side in one piece. Matthew Schanck, chair of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council, explained it is difficult to say whether the mast broke. "I think, and this is pure guess work, but the evidence that we are getting from the divers is the vessel is basically intact, lying on its side reportedly," he told the BBC. "If the mast was broken, that would be a significant thing that would be reported." Mr Schanck added he believed what happened to Bayesian was "a freak event". "Vessels aren\'t designed to be out sailing in that weather - 65 to 85mph that\'s the top of what a vessel would be out in and that\'s with its sails down," he said. "They aren\'t designed to sail through tornadoes or water spouts." Since mid-June the sea surrounding Sicily – the western Mediterranean Basin – has been experiencing a severe heatwave. The European Union’s climate change service, Copernicus, has been reporting sea surface temperatures in the region have repeatedly breached 30°C (80F) - four degrees higher than the 20-year average for this time of the year. Spanish researchers at the Institut de Ciencies del Mar in Barcelona confirmed last Thursday the maximum sea surface temperature record had been broken in the Mediterranean Sea. In both 2023 and 2024, the record was broken for the highest average temperature recorded around the world on one day.  Scientists put the rapidly rising temperatures down to climate change – oceans have taken the brunt of rising temperatures absorbing around 90% of the excess heat. Following last year’s record ocean temperatures, Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey told the BBC: "The fact that all this heat is going into the ocean, and in fact, it\'s warming in some respects even more rapidly than we thought it would, is a cause for great concern.” One sailing expert says hatches and doors left open overnight on the Bayesian may have caused it to sink. Weather records show temperatures reached about 33C the day before the sinking Sam Jefferson, editor of magazine Sailing Today, believe this may have led to the Bayesian\'s occupants wanting air to flow through while they slept. "I would have said that the boat got hit very hard by the wind, it was pinned over on its side," Mr Jefferson said. "I imagine all the doors were open because it was hot, so there were enough hatches and doors open that it filled with water very quickly and sank like that. "The reason it got pinned over so hard was because the mast is huge. It acted almost like a sail. [It] pushed the boat hard over on its side. "[The boat] filled with water before it could right. This is all speculation, but that\'s the only logical explanation." Recaldo Thomas, an experienced and respected sailing chef, was saving money to restore his late parents\' house. Six people are still missing after the British-flagged superyacht Bayesian sank during freak weather. Divers trained to work in small spaces are flown in but strong winds are making conditions harder. Survivors of the Bayesian say the ship "capsized within a few minutes", according to a doctor treating them. The Bayesian yacht was sunk by a sudden and powerful storm in the early hours of Monday morning. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Crowds cheered as he arrived in the Merseyside town shortly after 13:30 BST, where hundreds of tributes have been left to the victims.  During a private meeting the King heard about the experiences of some of the young children who were attacked, and also signed a book of condolence. The monarch also met regional leaders and heard from frontline staff representing Merseyside\'s police, fire and rescue and ambulance services at Southport Community Fire Station who responded to the attack. Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, died when a knifeman attacked at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Hart Street, on 29 July. Ten others were seriously injured including yoga teacher, Leanne Lucas, 35, who has recently been readmitted to hospital. Patrick Hurley, MP for Sefton, which includes Southport, met the King at the fire station, and said afterwards: "The town\'s emotions were raging and they still are very raw and he was very empathetic. "He was very keen to express his sympathy and empathy. Very keen to make sure the people of Southport know that from the symbolism perspective, the country\'s heart goes out to the people here." People began to gather outside the town hall from about 11:30 BST to catch a glimpse of the King. The King stopped to look at the flowers and cuddly toys and greet some of those gathered before going inside the town hall building to meet some of the children who survived the attack, their families and the police liaison team working with them. He walked around the tributes, waving to the crowd and shaking some hands, and was applauded as he walked into the building. Balloons in the shape of stars, hearts, a disco ball and the girls\' ages were among the tributes and messages were placed in frames. One read: "God has gained three beautiful new angels. May you dance forever in heaven and be at peace." Businessman John Hayes who was one of the first people on the scene of the stabbings was among those who met the King. Walking with the aid of crutches as he left the event, he said: "It was lovely to meet him. "I found him quite engaging, quite easy to talk to." Mr Hayes said: "I think he only arrived in Balmoral yesterday so for him to come all the way to Southport today to see people is very kind of him.  "And I’m sure everybody who met him got a lift from that." The 63-year-old heard children’s screams from the dance class on Hart Street and ran to confront the knifeman. He previously told BBC Radio 4 he was "hugely upset" he could not have done more to protect the children. Charles, who has been receiving cancer treatment this year, previously issued a statement in the wake of the stabbing, relating how he was "profoundly shocked to hear of the utterly horrific incident". Funerals have recently been held for Alice da Silva Aguiar and Bebe King, while a number of vigils for the victims have also taken place. The King had called for unity after unrest and disorder spread across England in the days following the attack. Outside the building, the King met members of the community who had helped in the aftermath of the attack. Paige, Harriet, Naomi, all aged 13, and 10-year-old Emie said they had raised £2,000 for Alder Hey Children\'s Hospital by selling lemonade. They said they were “excited and nervous” to meet the King.  Joanne Martlew, a retired emergency service worker, said she was driving past the dance class on the day of the attack when she saw victims coming out and went to help six of those injured.  She said it said it was “brilliant” to meet the monarch. Members of the Lord Street in Bloom gardening group, who have been looking after the flowers outside the town hall, were also there to meet the King as was siblings Antony and Jenna Johnson, who distributed free ice creams from their family business Triviso to children in Southport in the days after the attack. The King is also due to meet with the three bereaved families in London on Wednesday.

A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood. The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians. Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area. The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed. Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory\'s Hamas-run health ministry. Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike. The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building. "We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion," witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency. "The people are gone, they\'re dead. They are under the rubble." Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people. He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel. "Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence," it added. The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied. Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the "increasing frequency" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them "with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities". The warning after at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City, according to the director of a local hospital. The IDF said the school had "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 "terrorists" who were killed. The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities. Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah. The IDF said its troops and aircraft had "eliminated numerous terrorists" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device. It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. The BBC\'s Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation. After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties. But Hamas accused the US of "acquiescing" to what it called Mr Netanyahu\'s "new conditions". The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement. A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu\'s insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected.  He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war. BBC Scotland\'s Lynsey Bews considers the political fallout of the Scottish government\'s meeting with Israel\'s ambassador to the UK.  The cabinet secretary has come under fire from SNP colleagues over talks with the deputy ambassador. A security fence was breached but most demonstrators taking to Chicago\'s streets remained peaceful. US Secretary State Antony Blinken met with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to push for an urgent ceasefire.

Bradley McCarthy was sentenced on Tuesday after he was caught on video "threatening" left-wing protesters at an anti-immigration rally in Bristol. Separately, more people were jailed for their role in riots targeting a hotel housing asylum seekers, which was set alight and police hit by bricks and bottles. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says 494 people have so far been charged in relation to the weeks-long unrest that broke out in England and Northern Ireland after a fatal stabbing attack in Southport in which three young girls died. McCarthy, 34, had joined an anti-immigration march in Bristol which clashed with counter-protesters and police in Castle Park and on Bristol Bridge on 3 August.  Bristol Crown Court heard he played a "prominent" role in trying to goad police, and had "aggressively" shouted at a police dog. "You did all this in a tinderbox atmosphere where it only takes the actions of one person to spark very serious group violence," Judge Julian Lambert said.  McCarthy admitted violent disorder at a previous hearing. He has convictions for violence, weapons offences and public order.  Others were jailed for their actions during a riot that broke out outside a Rotherham hotel housing asylum seekers on 4 August. Apprentice bricklayer Alfie Conway, 19, from Pontefract, was jailed for two years and three months at Sheffield Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to violent disorder after throwing missiles at police who were protecting the Holiday Inn Express in Manvers. Lee Crisp, 42, was jailed for “actively encouraging” people who had gathered outside the hotel. The factory worker told officers they should be “ashamed of themselves,” shouted “let’s go toe to toe” and made racist comments. He was sentenced to three years and four months\' imprisonment and made subject of a criminal behaviour order for 10 years. Crisp had previously claimed he accidentally got caught up in the riot when taking his mother for Sunday lunch.  Craig Timbrell, 38, of Hartcliffe, appeared at Bristol Crown Court, charged with violent disorder over his "prominent role" in the unrest. He pleaded guilty to violent disorder after throwing concrete blocks, bricks and bottles at police near the hotel. Emily Evans, defending, said Timbrell, of Hartcliffe, had been planning on attending a ticketed social event in the city centre with friends, but had been unable to gain entry and "couldn\'t really explain" why he threw missiles at the police. But Judge Lambert said the violence he had shown was "intense and shocking" and sentenced him to two years and six months in prison.  Liam Gray, 20, from Mexborough in Doncaster, was filmed aggressively pushing against a line of officers who were trying to disperse the 400-strong crowd at the Holiday Inn Express, in Rotherham. He pleaded guilty to violent disorder and was sentenced to three years in a young offender institution and made the subject of a criminal behaviour order for 10 years. Ed Moss, defending, said his client’s family had been shocked when they learned of his involvement in the riot, adding: "Despite what it appears to everybody else, [they say] there isn’t a racist bone in his body." Meanwhile, roofer Alfie Arrowsmith, 28, was sentenced to 16 months\' imprisonment for his role in unrest on Whitehall, central London, on 31 July. He pleaded guilty to one charge of violent disorder after being filmed repeatedly confronting police and shouting "come on then" and "let\'s have it". Some 494 people have been charged with offences related to the recent public disorder as of Tuesday, the CPS said. As more people continue to be sentenced, concerns remain about the shortage of prison places available. Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens spoke to the BBC about Operation Early Dawn, which allows people to be held in police cells until prison space is freed up.  She said the measure would be "used for a matter of days or at the most months" because male prisons in some places were 99% full.  Asked about the maximum amount of time someone would be held in a police cell, Stevens said: "We would anticipate that this should be no longer than a day after being charged. That\'s the basis on which we are working." On Tuesday, King Charles travelled to Southport to meet survivors of the Southport knife attack.  He visited the town hall where tributes had been left outside in memory of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, who were murdered in the attack. The children were attending a Taylor Swift-themed dance class when the alleged attacker entered the building and stabbed them. Axel Rudakubana, who was aged 17 at the time, has been charged with murder and attempted murder. A motive for the attack has not been given, but it is not being treated as terror-related, police have said.  Copyright 2024 BBC.

Ms Harris broke with tradition and spoke at the start of the convention to voice her gratitude for her boss. "I want to kick us off by celebrating our incredible president, Joe Biden," she said. The evening showcased a range of speakers, from Olympic gold medal-winning basketball coach Steve Kerr to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But Mr Biden gave the prime-time address. He praised Ms Harris\'s leadership and promising that America\'s best days were "before us."  Here is a look back at the night\'s most memorable moments. Only four weeks ago, President Biden had every intention of closing the Democratic convention and watching a slate of speakers spend this week praising his administration.  But after a wild month for US politics, Biden instead spoke as a surrogate for his former running mate - a job he fulfilled at Chicago\'s United Center on the opening night of the convention.  Despite the change of fortune, Mr Biden was greeted by minutes of uninterrupted applause from a crowd of thousands. They chanted “Thank you Joe!” for his time in office and for his decision to pass the torch to Ms Harris. The loud and lasting cheers brought tears to Mr Biden’s eyes, after he hugged daughter Ashley Biden, who introduced him to the convention. He then gave a 50-minute speech, touting his administration\'s accomplishments and speaking about the threat that Republican nominee Donald Trump poses.  This speech could be one of the last the president gives in front of a crowd that size and with cheers that thunderous. The loudest applause line came near the end when he told the audience: "America, America, I gave my best to you." While the first night of the DNC featured some of the Democratic Party’s most seasoned leaders, including Mr Biden and Ms Clinton, much of the programme was dedicated to ushering in a new generation of Democrats. Several of the party’s rising stars were featured throughout the evening, including Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Monday appeared to serve as a means to pass the political torch from one generation to another and heal any perceived wounds that occurred over a difficult month for Democrats.  Several of the lawmakers who took the stage on Monday - including Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Delaware Senator Chris Coons - had advocated for Mr Biden to stay in the race just a few weeks ago.  But each one spoke about being all in for Ms Harris.  “Kamala Harris is for the middle class because she is from the middle class,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez told the convention in her first major party convention speech. Others who worked to push out Mr Biden from the presidential race - such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - cheered him on during his speech.  Thousands of demonstrators gathered in Chicago on Monday to protest the Biden administration’s support of Israel’s war in Gaza, but the issue received little mention during the first night of speeches at the DNC. While pro-Palestinian organisers saw smaller numbers than the “tens of thousands” they orginially expected, the demonstration outside the United Center proved to be energetic enough to break through a security barricade - leading to 13 arrests.  The demonstrators received one brief acknowledgement from Mr Biden during his speech on Monday night. He said that the Chicago protestors “have a point”, though he added that many innocent people were killed “on both sides”. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israel’s war in Gaza has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, while about 1,200 Israelis have been killed, according to their government. There are additional protests planned for the rest of the week at the DNC. Asked whether any Palestinians would be able to voice their concerns on the convention stage, a Harris campaign spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday that they did not have any scheduling updates. Labour was a prominent theme on Monday night - even Mr Biden labelled himself the most pro-labour president in American history.  But perhaps one of the most memorable lines of the night came from United Automobile Workers President Shawn Fain, who took the podium and called Trump a “scab” - someone who undermines organised workers. The insult - which was also featured on Mr Fain’s shirt - was met with an eruption of applause from the audience. Mr Fain was just one of several labour leaders to pledge support for Ms Harris at the DNC on Monday. Others included AFL-CIO President Elizabeth Shuler - a major union leader - and Brent Booker, the president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. Missing from the stage was Teamsters President Sean O\'Brien, who gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. After much backlash, the Teamsters president requested a speaking slot at the DNC - but he did not obtain one.  In a speech that echoed remarks she gave at her own DNC nomination just eight years ago, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the crowd Ms Harris would be the first to break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in the US. Ms Clinton made her own unsuccessful run to become America’s first female president in 2016, losing to Trump in an election that shocked many. But, taking the stage once again at the DNC on Monday night, the longtime Democratic politician stressed her belief that Ms Harris would have a better outcome.  “On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris raising her hand and taking the oath of office as our 47th President of the United States.” Ms Clinton - who is reportedly a close adviser of Ms Harris - said her defeat in 2016 inspired millions of women to march, run for office and keep “our eyes on the future of America”. To loud applauses from the crowd, she repeated a line from her 2016 speech almost word for word: “When a barrier falls for one of us, it clears the way for all of us." Prominent party leaders, celebrities and nearly 50,000 people are gathering in Chicago for the DNC.  A educator and prison reform advocate, Gwen Walz advises her husband from an office in the Minnesota capitol.  The small group of protestors who had breached the outer security perimeter were quickly removed by police. The former Los Angeles entertainment lawyer could make his own history if his wife, Kamala Harris, is elected president in November.

The Italian tested positive for low levels of a metabolite of clostebol - a steroid that can be used to build muscle mass - during Indian Wells. A further sample taken eight days later also tested positive for low levels of the same metabolite. A provisional suspension was applied automatically but, as Sinner challenged it successfully, he was able to keep playing. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) found Sinner was inadvertently contaminated with the substance by Giacomo Naldi, his physiotherapist. Naldi had been applying an over-the-counter spray available in Italy to a cut on his own hand and had then carried out treatments on Sinner. The ITIA accepted the explanation and that the violation was not intentional. Sinner was cleared of fault or negligence by an independent tribunal last week, but he will lose the ranking points and prize money from his semi-final run at Indian Wells. â\x80\x9cI will now put this challenging and deeply unfortunate period behind me," Sinner said in a statement. "I will continue to do everything I can to ensure I continue to comply with the ITIA\'s anti-doping programme. "I have a team around me that are meticulous in their own compliance." Clostebol, often found in products to treat swelling and irritation, is on the World Anti-Doping Agency\'s list of prohibited substances. Australian Open champion Sinner will be the top seed at the US Open, which begins on Monday. Sinner beats Tiafoe to win Cincinnati Open title Sinner was ruled to bear no fault or negligence for the positive tests. The ITIA described the levels found in Sinner\'s sample as "low". His lawyers said it amounted to "less than a billionth of a gram". The full decision, published by the ITIA,, external states that Naldi cut the finger of his left hand on a scalpel in his treatment bag on 3 March. Naldi bandaged the cut and unwrapped it two days later. Umberto Ferrara, Sinner\'s fitness coach, recommended the physio use a medical spray Ferrara had bought in an Italian pharmacy in February on the cut. The physio said he did not check the contents of the spray, which he used every morning from 5-13 March, with Indian Wells taking place from 6-17 March. Between those dates, Naldi gave Sinner full-body massages and applied bandages to his feet. He did not wear gloves while carrying out the treatments. Sinner stated that he suffers from a skin condition on his feet and back that leads to scratching and can cause small cuts and lesions in the affected areas. On the morning of 10 March, Naldi treated Sinner\'s feet and ankle. He said he would have applied the spray twice that morning, and that he "cannot remember" washing his hands between spraying his finger and treating Sinner\'s feet. Sinner and his team co-operated fully with the investigation. The ITIA accepted Sinner had no knowledge of either the spray or that it contained a prohibited substance, and did not know Naldi had used it on his cut finger. Three independent experts also concluded Sinner\'s explanation was plausible, with one stating the amount administered "would not have had... any relevant doping, or performance enhancing, effect on the player". The ITIA stated that the violation was not intentional before referring the case to an independent tribunal to determine "what, if any, fault the player bore and therefore the appropriate outcome". The independent tribunal subsequently determined a finding of no fault or negligence, meaning the 23-year-old would not be suspended. However, he will lose his 400 ranking points and $325,000 prize money from Indian Wells. The ruling is also subject to any appeal by Wada.  Under the World Anti-Doping Cope, a provisional suspension is automatically applied when a player tests positive for a non-specified substance. Players have the right to apply to an independent tribunal chair to have that suspension lifted. On both occasions, Sinner appealed successfully against the suspension and was able to provide an explanation of how the substance had entered his system. The ITIA subsequently consulted with scientific experts, who said Sinner\'s explanation was credible, and as a result, they did not oppose his appeal against his provisional suspension. Karen Moorhouse, the chief executive of the ITIA, said the body took any positive test "extremely seriously and will always apply the rigorous processes set out by Wada". "The ITIA carried out a thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to the positive tests with which Mr Sinner and his representatives fully co-operated," she said. "Following that investigation, the ITIA accepted the player\'s explanation as to the source of the clostebol and that the presence of the substance was not intentional.  This was also accepted by the tribunal. "We thank the independent tribunal for the speed and clarity of its decision in relation to the player\'s degree of fault." Sinner\'s lawyer, Jamie Singer, said: "Anti-doping rules have to be very strict to be effective. Sadly the unfortunate consequence is that, occasionally, entirely innocent athletes get caught up in them.  "There is no question that Jannik is innocent in this case. The ITIA did not challenge that key principle.  "However, under strict liability rules Jannik is responsible for whatever is in his system, even when entirely unaware of it, as in this exceptional case." The ATP Tour - the governing body of men\'s tennis - said integrity is "paramount in our sport".

The scheme, which the EU confirms on its website will start "in the first half of 2025", will cover people from more than 60 non-EU countries including the UK. In comments first reported by The Times, EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson suggested the visa waiver may be in place by the May half-term holiday in 2025. She was speaking as she confirmed the Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) - which will require non-EU travellers to register fingerprints and a photo instead of having their passport stamped - will start on 10 November. Under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), passengers must apply for a waiver, similar to the US ESTA, before travel, and this will be valid for three years or until their passport expires, whichever is first. It will cover travel to the Schengen Area, which includes every EU state except for Ireland and Cyprus, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.  A Home Office spokesperson said it expects the EU to provide more information on the rollout of the scheme "in due course". The update comes as the EU launched its much-anticipated EES scheme, after a series of delays. In a statement, Ms Johansson said: "After intense dialogues with Member States, with you, with the different stakeholders – I have decided that the Entry/Exit System will enter into operations on 10 November." She said the ETIAS visa scheme would launch six months later, according to the Times. Ms Johansson said the EES system would mean "every single airport", "harbour" or "road into Europe" would have strict digital border controls. More than 700 million tourists entered Europe last year, she said, and the new systems would help Europeans "sleep safer". The rules would mean "we will know if people stay too long" and it "will make it harder for criminals, terrorists or Russian spies to use fake passports", she added.  Under the EES scheme, people entering the EU will have to register fingerprints, a photo and passport details. That initial registration will be valid for three years, during which time it must be validated every time someone crosses the border. This will replace passport-stamping. However, long queues have been predicted, with experts warning it could add at least two minutes processing time per passenger, compared with the current 45 seconds. Juxtaposed border controls mean French border police check passports as people leave the UK to cross the Channel from Dover, London St Pancras and Folkestone. Anyone from a non-EU country currently has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which includes the US, Japan and Australia, as well as the UK. People from these countries can travel within the EU\'s Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa. However, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls. This has led to it introducing the ETIAS which, the EU Commission points out, is "way cheaper" than the $14 US ESTA. The ETIAS will allow trips to the 27 EU member states, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. An ETIAS will last for three years and allow an unlimited number of entries. The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border. The EU says the ETIAS system will "strengthen security checks on those persons who travel visa-free to the EU". Passengers will need to apply online or via a mobile app. The form - which the EU describes as a "necessary and small procedural step" - will take no more than 10 minutes to complete. The details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions. More than 95% of applications will be approved automatically within minutes. However, some cases may take up to 72 hours, the EU warns. Applications can also be denied or take up to four weeks to process in exceptional circumstances. The fee will apply to anyone between the ages of 18 and 70, but the waiver will be free for children and the over-70s. Reports of deaths and alleged ill treatment abound but few are investigated, according to the Fundamental Rights Agency. A government minister says when negotiating with the EU he intends to have Northern Ireland at the forefront. The port plans to change the location of passport control for passengers arriving to board ferries. The bill will allow troops to open fire on migrants crossing the border when soldiers feel under threat. It said the benefits of the treatment did not outweigh the risk of serious side effects.

Ukraine\'s military has not confirmed the loss of Niu-York, saying only that Russian forces are attacking close to the town and other areas. The army was giving the attacks "a worthy rebuff... and the fighting continues", it said. Although only a small settlement, controlling Niu-York would represent another step towards the two Donetsk hubs of Toretsk and Pokrovsk. One of the aims of Ukraine\'s seizure of territory in Russia\'s Kursk region is thought to be to force Russia to move some of its forces away from the eastern campaign.  There is no indication so far of that happening, despite Ukraine\'s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi now claiming control of 93 Russian villages and towns. President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation in the east as difficult, but said Ukrainian troops were doing all they could to destroy the Russian forces. The military chief told a briefing that Russia was sending additional troops to the front line in the east. A Russia defence ministry statement said active operations by units of its Centre forces group had defeated Ukrainian troops, referring to Niu-York as "one of the largest settlements of the Toretsk agglomeration and a strategically important logistics hub". It also called the town by the Russian name of Novgorodskoye. Russian military bloggers shared footage late on Monday of a Russian tricolor flag being posted on the roof of a school in Niu-York with the Ukrainian flag lying on the ground.  However, the video first circulated two weeks ago and Ukrainian forces had since blown up the flag and damaged the roof with a drone on 8 August. Niu-York is just south of the mining town of Toretsk, and Russian forces on Monday said they had also captured Zalizne, to the south-east of Toretsk. Ukrainian forces said they were still fighting back in Zalizne and local sources were quoted as saying they still had control of 20% of Niu-York too, although they had far fewer reserves than the Russians. On Monday, Ukrainian authorities ordered the evacuation of Pokrovsk, as Russian forces continue to advance on the town. According to a military briefing on Tuesday, Russia had directed more than a third of its 87 attacks during the day on it push towards Pokrovsk. Local officials say Russia\'s military is now about 10km (6 miles) from the outskirts of the town. Regional head Vadym Filashkin has said 53,000 people still live in Pokrovsk, including almost 4,000 children. Ukraine\'s commander in chief said the counter-offensive in Russia\'s Kursk region had now advanced 28-35km beyond the border, with 1,263 sq km under Ukrainian control and a total of 93 population centres. Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said three new military groupings had been formed to counter the Ukrainian operation in three border regions, Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk. Their task would be to protect "citizens and territories from attacks" from drones and other and other assault means. Russian officials have played down the success of the Ukrainian operation in the Kursk region.  Maj Gen Apti Alaudinov, commander of Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces unit, told Russian TV that Ukraine\'s military had sustained very serious losses. Asked to respond to reports that three bridges had been blown up over the River Seym, cutting off evacuation and supply routes, he said "the fact that some bridge has been blown up doesn’t mean anything". However, state news agency Tass says local police are now having to use privately owned boats to get civilians to safety because bridges are down. German photographer Nanna Heitmann said she had spoken to Russians in the region who were furious that state media were not giving the full picture: "They\'re shocked, they are angry. A lot of people wait, thousands of people waiting in lines to find shelter, to find basic needs like blankets, pillows etc." Russia\'s Vladimir Putin, who has appeared wrong-footed by the Ukrainian offensive, compared it on Tuesday to a 2004 school massacre by Chechen militants in Beslan where more than 300 people were killed. On a visit to the school and to mothers of the victims in North Ossetia, he said "just as we fought with terrorists previously, now we fight with those who commit crimes in Kursk region, Donbas and Novorossiya", using an old Russian imperial term for areas of occupied Ukraine. Additional reporting by BBC Verify The 19-year-old describes his arrest, surviving Russian jail and being part of the recent prisoner swap. Officials said families with children living in Pokrovsk and surrounding villages would be forced to leave.  Volodymyr Zelensky says UK support has "slowed down" as he repeats plea for long-range missile capability.  Three-year-old lioness Yuna has arrived at her new enclosure at The Big Cat Sanctuary.

He pleaded guilty to one charge of misconduct in public office at Wolverhampton Crown Court earlier. West Midlands Fire Service said Hancel was dismissed in August 2023 after the matter came to its attention. "There is no place in our service for people who undertake such actions," a spokesperson for the fire service said. "His conduct compounded the grief of the victim’s family and loved ones, and they remain in our thoughts." A second charge under the 2003 Communications Act was withdrawn. The court heard how Hancel was of good character and had not been in trouble before. During the hearing on Tuesday, the former firefighter spoke only to confirm his name and enter his plea. Judge Talog Davies accepted a request from the defence to adjourn sentencing for a pre-sentence report to be compiled. Hancel, who was released on unconditional bail, hid his face under a baseball cap as he left the court building about two hours after the hearing had concluded.

Jeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney and the owners of a restaurant after his wife died in 2023 from a severe allergic reaction following a meal at Disney World, in Florida. Disney had argued the case should instead go to arbitration because of a clause in the terms and conditions of its Disney+ streaming service, which Mr Piccolo had briefly signed up for in 2019. But, following a backlash, it has decided the matter can now be heard in court. "We believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss," Disney\'s Josh D\'Amaro told the BBC in a statement. "As such, we\'ve decided to waive our right to arbitration and have the matter proceed in court." Lawyers for Mr Piccolo said: "Attempts by corporations like Disney to avoid jury trials should be looked at with skepticism", adding that Mr Piccolo will "continue to pursue justice on behalf of his beloved wife at the trial court level". "He also hopes these recent events have raised awareness of the millions of people of all ages and walks of life who suffer with food allergies", his lawyers said. In arbitration, a dispute is overseen by a neutral third party. It benefits those wanting to avoid a lengthy trial, but means evidence would not be put in front of a jury. Jamie Cartwright, partner at the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, suggested Disney\'s change of heart was motivated by the "adverse publicity" its initial approach had generated. "In attempting to push the claim into a confidential setting on what were very tenuous grounds, it succeeded only in creating the very publicity and attention it likely wanted to avoid," he told the BBC. Mr Piccolo and his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, ate a meal at Raglan Road, an Ireland-themed pub located at the Disney Springs site, in Orlando, but operated by an independent company.  He alleges that the restaurant did not take enough care over his wife\'s severe allergies to dairy and nuts, despite being repeatedly told about them. She died in hospital later that day. According to the legal filing, her death was confirmed by a medical examiner "as a result of anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system." Mr Piccolo is suing Disney for a sum in excess of $50,000 (£38,400), in addition to other damages relating to suffering, loss of income, and medical and legal costs. Disney has argued it had no control over the management and operation of the restaurant. Lawyers for Mr Piccolo had said Disney\'s argument that the lawsuit should not be heard in court "borders on the surreal."  It is not known whether Disney would have been successful had a judge ruled on its arbitration claim.  Disney had argued that the legal circumstances surrounding the case were unique. But legal experts told the BBC they had been "pushing the envelope of contract law". "Disney’s argument that accepting their terms and conditions for one product covers all interactions with that company is novel and potentially far-reaching," Ernest Aduwa, partner at Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, who are not involved in the proceedings, said. Meanwhile, Jibreel Tramboo, barrister at Church Court Chambers, said the terms in the Disney+ trial were a "weak argument for Disney to rely on". Disney says it is in the process of submitting a filing to the court to withdraw its call for arbitration. Additional reporting by Graham Fraser Copyright 2024 BBC.

The move comes less than two months after José Raúl Mulino was sworn in as Panama\'s president. Mr Mulino campaigned on a promise to "close" the Darién Gap, the dangerous stretch of jungle which more than half a million migrants crossed last year on their way north from South America. The Biden administration said it had agreed to pay for the flights as part of its efforts to deter irregular migration. A group of 29 Colombians with criminal records were the first to be returned on Tuesday. Under an agreement jointly signed by the Panamanian foreign minister and US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the US has committed to helping Panama with $6m (£4.6m) for equipment, transportation and logistics to "remove foreign nationals who do not have a legal basis to remain in Panama". Immigration is a hot topic ahead of November\'s presidential election in the US and the stream of migrants arriving at its border with Mexico is being closely monitored. The agreement with Panama aims to drive down the number of people making it to the US border by stopping them further south. The Darién Gap, an expanse of jungle which straddles Colombia and Panama, is a natural bottleneck for those heading from South to North America.  In 2023, an estimated 520,000 people made the perilous journey on foot, many of whom had to pay gangs who prey on those embarking on the crossing.  President Mulino, who has promised to reduce the number of migrants transiting through Panama, described their situation as "sad". "Most of them are from Venezuela," he explained. "They\'re human beings... there are families torn apart, children of five or six years of age whose parents have died during the crossing. We don\'t even know who they are or what their names are."  The president had earlier said that the flights would in the first instance take migrants to Colombia, the country from which they entered Panama. It is not yet clear if flights will be organised from Colombia to repatriate them to their homelands.  According to Panamanian government figures, Venezuelans form the largest share of migrants trekking through the Darién Gap, followed by Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Haitians.  There is widespread concern in the region that the flow of those fleeing Venezuela could increase in the months to come if the political crisis triggered by the announcement of disputed election results is not solved.  Ahead of the election, polls had suggested that large numbers of Venezuelans were planning on migrating should President Nicolás Maduro win. Tension has been high since he was declared the winner by the government-dominated National Electoral Council, with the result being rejected as fraudulent by the opposition and questioned by the US, the EU and many Latin American countries. Panamanian President Mulino earlier this month offered Mr Maduro "safe passage" so that the Venezuelan leader could leave to a third country, but his offer was rejected by Mr Maduro, who warned his Panamanian counterpart not to "mess" with Venezuela.  In 1961, Ms Colvin began tutoring out of her basement. Her initiative grew into a worldwide literacy movement. Prominent party leaders, celebrities and nearly 50,000 people are gathering in Chicago for the DNC.  A sudden storm and wind gusts in Hilsboro, Alabama, sent the inflatable castle tumbling and flying. A educator and prison reform advocate, Gwen Walz advises her husband from an office in the Minnesota capitol.  The Never Need Me singer had been due to support Remi Wolf but says it\'s too expensive.

The vessel\'s cook - understood to be Recaldo Thomas - has died and his body has been recovered, according to Sicily\'s civil protection agency.  Some 15 people have been rescued from the boat, while six remain missing.  Specialist divers from the Italian fire brigade resumed their search early on Tuesday morning.  The body of a man recovered near the Bayesian yacht is believed to be that of Recaldo Thomas, a Canadian-Antiguan chef who was working on the boat. His friends have been paying tribute to him. Gareth Williams, who lives in Antigua, knew Thomas for 30 years. "I can talk for everyone that knew him when I say he was a well-loved, kind human being with a calm spirit," he told the BBC. The two grew up together in Antigua, where Thomas spent his time during off-season. "He would come over to mine over the weekend and he would sing. He had the deepest, most sultry voice in the world, and a smile that lit up the room. "He told me just the other day that he needed to work two more seasons to fix up his late parents\' house. He loved yachting, but he was tired." The six people who are unaccounted for have all been named. Among them are British businessman Mike Lynch, who was recently acquitted of fraud in the US.  Several people on the boat, including some who are missing, were involved in his recent trial and there have been reports that the yacht trip was a celebration of Mr Lynch’s acquittal. Mr Lynch is a tech entrepreneur who was once regarded by some as “Britain’s Bill Gates”. Raised in Essex, he went on to study at the University of Cambridge, before co-founding software company Autonomy in 1996. The 59-year-old made his riches by selling the company to US tech giant Hewlett-Packard in 2011 for $11bn (£8.6bn). Mr Lynch became embroiled in a decade-long legal battle following the acquisition. He was acquitted in the US in June on multiple fraud charges, over which he had been facing two decades in jail. He told BBC Radio 4 in August that he believed he had only been able to prove his innocence in US court because he was rich enough to pay the enormous legal fees involved. "You shouldn\'t need to have funds to protect yourself as a British citizen," he said. Mr Lynch was travelling with his daughter Hannah, who is also missing. The 18-year-old is reportedly the younger of Mr Lynch\'s two daughters.  She had just completed her A-levels and secured a place to read English at Oxford University, according to the Times. Chris Morvillo is a lawyer who represented Mr Lynch in his US trial. Since 2011, he has been a partner at the Clifford Chance law firm in New York. His biography on the firm’s website says that he served as assistant attorney for the southern district of New York from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure, he worked on the criminal investigation surrounding the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. American jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, wife of Mr Morvillo, is also unaccounted for. Mr Morvillo\'s employer, Clifford Chance, confirmed the news. In a statement, a spokesperson for the law firm said: "We are in shock and deeply saddened by this tragic incident." Ms Morvillo designs jewellery under the name Neda Nassiri. Her website says she "has been designing and hand-crafting fine jewelry in New York City for over 20 years". Jonathan Bloomer is the chairman of the Morgan Stanley International bank and insurance company Hiscox. The 70-year-old Briton was educated at Imperial College London and has previously served on a number of company boards. Mr Bloomer appeared at trial as a defence witness for Mr Lynch, according to the the Financial Times. Media reports suggest the pair are close friends. Aki Hussain, group chief executive of Hiscox, which Mr Bloomer has chaired since 2023, said: "We are deeply shocked and saddened by this tragic event. "Our thoughts are with all those affected, in particular our chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife Judy, who are among the missing.” Judy, the wife of Jonathan Bloomer, is also among the six people missing. Ms Bloomer is listed as a former director of property developer Change Real Estate along with her husband. She has been called a "brilliant champion for women\'s health" by a charity she has worked closely with. Ms Bloomer has been a trustee and supporter of gynaecological cancer research charity the Eve Appeal for more than 20 years.  The charity\'s chief executive, Athena Lamnisos, said she was "deeply shocked to hear the news that our very dear friend and her husband Jonathan, are among those missing". "Our thoughts are with Judy and Jonathan’s family, as well as all those who are still waiting for news after this tragic event," she added in a statement. Among the 15 people who were rescued are nine members of the yacht\'s crew.  This means every member of the crew is accounted for minus the chef, who local authorities say has died. Eight of the 15 who were rescued have been taken to hospital. A British mother, named locally as Charlotte Golunski, was travelling on the yacht with her partner and baby girl. All three have been rescued from the boat. In an interview, she described holding her infant daughter above the surface of the sea to save her from drowning.  Ms Golunski is a partner at Mr Lynch’s company, Invoke Capital, where she has worked since 2012, according to her LinkedIn profile. The Times has reported that she has previously worked for Autonomy, the company at the centre of Mr Lynch\'s recent court case. Another lawyer, Ayla Ronald, was also rescued along with her partner. The New Zealand national works for Clifford Chance, where Mr Morvillo is a partner, and was part of Mr Lynch\'s legal team for his June trial. Her father told the Telegraph that she was "invited to go sailing as a result of the success in the recent United States court case".  Angela Bacares, Mr Lynch\'s wife and Hannah Lynch\'s mother, is also among those who have been rescued. On Monday, Ms Bacares was using a wheelchair after suffering \xadabrasions on her feet, according to the newspaper La Repubblica. Recaldo Thomas, an experienced and respected sailing chef, was saving money to restore his late parents\' house. As the rescue operation continues off the Italian coast, questions remain as to why the superyacht sank. Divers trained to work in small spaces are flown in but strong winds are making conditions harder. Survivors of the Bayesian say the ship "capsized within a few minutes", according to a doctor treating them. The Bayesian yacht was sunk by a sudden and powerful storm in the early hours of Monday morning. Copyright 2024 BBC.

As a coastguard helicopter whirls overhead, divers are being despatched from the port, continuing their search for the six missing passengers of the Bayesian, which capsized before dawn on Monday and whose wreckage now lies some 50m (165ft) underwater on the seabed.  Luca Cari from Italy’s fire and rescue department said that, given the depth, divers were only allowed 10 minutes underwater before resurfacing, limiting their work.  Divers trained to work in small spaces have been flown in from Rome and Sardinia. Strong winds are making the conditions even harder. The divers found no bodies on the bridge – the room in which the captain controlled the vessel – and have made it into the lounge, from where they are working to gain access to the rest of the yacht.  It’s expected that the six missing passengers will be trapped in the cabins, where they were likely sleeping when it capsized. Among the missing are the British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch along with his 18-year-old daughter Hannah; his lawyer, Mike Corvillo and his wife Neda; and the president of Morgan Stanley international Jonathan Bloomer and his wife Judy.  The body of the yacht’s chef has already been found. He is believed to be Recaldo Thomas, a Canadian-Antiguan. Mr Lynch’s wife, Angela Bacares, is among the 15 people rescued, when they scrambled into a life raft and set off a flare, that drew the attention of another boat captain.  The tragedy began on Sunday night with violent storms buffeting the boats here.  In the early hours of Monday, that prompted a waterspout – a tornado-like rotating column of cloud and water that engulfed the Bayesian. Witnesses say it snapped the 76m (249ft) tall aluminium mast and quickly engulfed it.  Recent searing heat and heavy winds had reportedly prompted a weather warning prior to the capsizing. The temperature of the Mediterranean was 30C – higher than normal - amplifying the likelihood of an extreme weather event. Among the survivors are several British nationals, who are staying at a local hotel, to which journalists were denied access.  They include Charlotte Golunski, who clutched her one-year-old daughter above the water to keep her alive, telling how all she could hear were the screams around her. The British ambassador to Italy, Ed Llewellyn, told me he had visited the survivors and heard their anguish. “It underlines what a desperately sad and distressing situation they found themselves in,” he said.  “My heart, and I’m sure that of the whole country, goes out to them. We will do whatever we can practically to help in this very difficult and heartbreaking situation.” He confirmed that marine investigators sent from the UK had arrived in Sicily and were working with their Italian counterparts on a preliminary assessment.  Local prosecutors have also opened an investigation into the circumstances of the tragedy – and if anything could have been done to mitigate it, including closing the ship’s hatches overnight. The yacht’s captain, James Catfield, from New Zealand, told Italian media of the suddenness of the waterspout that turned a luxury super yacht into a death trap. “We just didn’t see it coming”, he said. Recaldo Thomas, an experienced and respected sailing chef, was saving money to restore his late parents\' house. Six people are still missing after the British-flagged superyacht Bayesian sank during freak weather. As the rescue operation continues off the Italian coast, questions remain as to why the superyacht sank. Survivors of the Bayesian say the ship "capsized within a few minutes", according to a doctor treating them. The Bayesian yacht was sunk by a sudden and powerful storm in the early hours of Monday morning. Copyright 2024 BBC.

The mother, named as Charlotte Golunski, her partner and one-year-old daughter are reported to be among 15 people to have been rescued from the luxury yacht Bayesian early on Monday. Six people - including British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch - are missing with one man found dead outside the wreckage.  Charlotte told Italian newspaper La Repubblica her family survived only because they were on deck when the yacht sank after encountering a heavy storm.  She said they were woken by “thunder, lightning and waves that made our boat dance”, and it felt like "the end of the world" before they were thrown into the water.  The 56m (183ft) vessel, which was carrying 10 crew and 12 passengers, sank half a mile off the coast of Palermo after the storm caused waterspouts, or rotating columns of air, to appear over the sea. “For two seconds I lost my daughter in the sea then quickly hugged her amid the fury of the waves,” the paper quoted her as saying. Charlotte said she held her baby "afloat with all my strength, my arms stretched upwards to keep her from drowning". “It was all dark. In the water I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I screamed for help but all I could hear around me was the screams of others," she added. A lifeboat inflated and she said 11 people were able to climb in. All three of the family were unharmed and taken to hospital for check-ups.  Karsten Borner, captain of a nearby boat, said his crew took on board some survivors on a life raft, including three who were seriously injured. Describing the moment, the storm hit, he told Italian news outlet Rai the superyacht tipped to its side and sank within "a few minutes" "It all happened in really little time," he said.  A local fisherman, Giuseppe, told Reuters he was on board a motorboat when he saw "mats and T-shirts floating in the sea". Another witness, Fabio Cefalù, captain of a trawler, says he was about to go out on a fishing trip when he saw flashes of lightning so he stayed in the harbour. "At about 4:15am we saw a flare in the sea," he said, according to the EVN news agency reports. "We waited for this waterspout to pass. After 10 minutes we went out to the sea and we saw cushions and all the rest of the boat [that had sunk], and everything which was on the deck, at sea. However, we did not see any people in the sea.” Another fisherman described seeing the yacht "sinking with my own eyes". Speaking to the newspaper Giornale di Sicilia, the witness said he was at home when the tornado hit. "Then I saw the boat, it had only one mast, it was very big," he said. Shortly afterwards he went down to the Santa Nicolicchia bay in Porticello, the fishing village near Palermo where the disaster unfolded, to get a better look at what was happening. He added: "The boat was still floating, then all of a sudden it disappeared. I saw it sinking with my own eyes." Rescue operations continue for those still missing after the Bayesian yacht sank off the coast of Sicily. Six people are still missing after the British-flagged superyacht Bayesian sank during freak weather. Divers trained to work in small spaces are flown in but strong winds are making conditions harder. The Bayesian yacht was sunk by a sudden and powerful storm in the early hours of Monday morning.

After co-founding British tech firm Autonomy in 1996, and backing several successful tech firms, the businessman was regarded by some as the UK\'s answer to Microsoft founder Bill Gates. One person is dead and six are missing after a 56m superyacht called Bayesian, which has been linked to Mr Lynch\'s family, sank following bad weather. His wife, Angela Bacares, has been rescued. The British tech tycoon made his riches by selling his company Autonomy to US computing giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 2011 for $11bn (£8.6bn). But an intense legal battle following the high-profile acquisition loomed over Mr Lynch for more than a decade. He was acquitted in the US in June on multiple fraud charges, over which he had been facing two decades in jail. In an interview on BBC Radio 4 in August, Mr Lynch said that he believed he had only been able to prove his innocence in a US court due to his wealth. The sinking of the yacht came on the same day that Mr Lynch\'s co-defendant in the fraud case, Stephen Chamberlain, was confirmed by his lawyer as having died after being hit by a car in Cambridgeshire on Saturday. Born on 16 June 1965, Mr Lynch is the son of a nurse and a fireman, and was raised near Chelmsford in Essex.  He studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a PhD in mathematical computing, and later undertook a research fellowship. In 1991, Mr Lynch helped establish Cambridge Neurodynamics - a firm which specialised in using computer-based detection and recognition of fingerprints. His tech firm Autonomy was created five years later, using a statistical method known as "Bayesian inference" at the core of its software. The company\'s fast-paced growth and success throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s saw Mr Lynch earn a number of awards and accolades. In 2006 he was awarded an OBE in recognition of his service to UK enterprise. He served on the board of the BBC as a non-executive director, and in 2011 was appointed to the government\'s council for science and technology - advising then-Prime Minister David Cameron on the risks and possibilities of AI development. After Autonomy\'s sale to HP in 2011 - from which Mr Lynch is believed to have netted £500m - he went on to establish tech investment firm Invoke Capital. The venture capital fund invested in the creation of British cyber security company Darktrace in 2013. Mr Lynch, a shareholder in the firm, held a seat on its board until earlier this year. Mr Lynch and his wife Angela Bacares have two daughters, and live at the Loudham Hall estate in Suffolk. His daughter Hannah, 18, was also on the yacht which sank. The director general of Sicily\'s civil protection agency, Salvatore Cocina, told the BBC that Mr Lynch, his daughter and the yacht\'s chef were among the missing. BBC Verify looked at corporate records and found the Bayesian\'s ownership is tied to the family. Sources close to the matter have confirmed to the BBC that Ms Bacares has been rescued. Meanwhile, Stephen Chamberlain, Mr Lynch\'s co-defendant in the Autonomy trial, has also died, after being hit by a car. Mr Chamberlain was out running in Cambridgeshire on Saturday when he was fatally struck by the vehicle. Autonomy became successful for its software\'s ability to extract useful information from data such as phone calls, emails and video. It would then use this data to do things like suggest answers to a call-centre operator or monitor TV channels for words or subjects. Prior to its purchase by HP in 2011, Autonomy had headquarters in San Francisco and Cambridge. But the price tag came under scrutiny following the sale and Autonomy\'s value was written down by billions just a year later. In 2018, US prosecutors brought charges against Mr Lynch - accusing him of artificially inflating the company\'s value. They said he had concealed the firm\'s loss-making business reselling hardware, and also accused him of intimidating or paying off people who raised concerns. Mr Lynch told BBC Radio 4 at the start of August that while convinced of his innocence throughout the lengthy trial, he felt he was only able to prove his this in US court due to his wealth. "You shouldn\'t need to have funds to protect yourself as a British citizen," he said. "The reason I\'m sitting here, let\'s be honest, is not only because I was innocent... but because I had enough money not to be swept away by a process that\'s set up to sweep you away." He added that following the lengthy legal saga, he wanted "to get back to what I love doing, which is innovating". Copyright 2024 BBC.

She was someone with direct and painful experience of Scotland\'s horrendous drug death tally – figures which are rising again, and remain significantly higher than those in the rest of Europe. Jade told us she had been using heroin and cocaine for years "as a coping mechanism" to block out trauma from her past. And she said she knew a lot of people whose lives had been taken by drugs. "My ex-partner died of drugs. My dad died - he was an addict. “My sister passed away. A lot of my friends have passed away. "I\'ve seen too many people dying through drugs," she said. On 18 March this year, Jade was found dead in a flat in the Gorbals area of Glasgow. She was 34 years old. Jade\'s family did not want to be interviewed on camera but wanted to highlight the work being done to help people with addiction. We have chosen not to use her surname for their privacy. Jade\'s relatives praised the drug workers in Glasgow who had helped her time and again. But when two police officers arrived at the door with news of her death, they said it did not come as a shock. On the contrary, it was a moment they had both feared and expected for many years. "We knew it was going to happen," one family member said to us. After police inquiries concluded, Jade\'s family were told that her death was drug-related but not a criminal matter. According to the latest official figures men were twice as likely to be the victim of a drug-related death than women last year, after adjusting for age. But that gap has narrowed since the early 2000s, when men were four or five times more likely to die.  Drugs workers say it can often be harder to help women than men. Heather Wilkins, gendered services project manager for Dundee Volunteer and Voluntary Action, said that many female drug users used illegal substances as "a coping mechanism" to deal with "complex trauma," such as domestic abuse, rape and sexual abuse. Ms Wilkins did not know Jade and was not commenting on her case specifically. She said women tended to seek help at a later stage than men because of "perceived shame" in doing so, especially if they were mothers with concerns about the potential impact on their children. Ms Wilkins said they had tried to tackle those issues in Dundee by bringing together organisations dealing with mental health, housing and welfare along with elements of the justice system, psychologists and medical professionals. She said the resulting Dundee Women\'s Hub could be a model for other parts of the country in providing comprehensive and sustained support for drug users. "We\'ve got quite a wide variety of organisations and drug and alcohol services to support the women that are coming through – and you can get all that support in one place," added Ms Wilkins. Dundee is also hoping to pilot another idea which could potentially save lives – a drug-checking pilot which would allow users to submit a drug sample for testing to identify the substance or substances they were planning to take. Danny Kelly is from Hillcrest Futures, the charity which submitted the application to the Home Office. He said that, if approved, "it gives us accurate information on what people are using and what\'s used across the community and, by having that, it means that we could give targeted harm reduction information". Two other cities are also applying for a drugs testing licence, Aberdeen and Glasgow. In Glasgow, it would be based at an official consumption room for illegal drugs, including heroin and cocaine, which is under construction at a health centre in the east end of the city.  The project, a UK first, is running a few months behind schedule and is due to open on 21 October. Dr Saket Priyadarshi, who is in charge of the pilot project, told us that 2023 had been another difficult year for drug use in Glasgow. "The drug market has never been as toxic and as volatile as it is at the moment," said Dr Priyadarshi, the associate medical director of Glasgow alcohol and drug recovery services. He said there had been "a very significant change" in the drug trends and drug use patterns in the city. "People who inject drugs in Glasgow city centre, for example, are just as likely to be injecting cocaine as they are heroin," he explained. "We need to be investing heavily in all evidence-based interventions and innovations in our drug services and treatment care services across Scotland." When we interviewed her last September, Jade had been enthusiastic about plans for the consumption room and drug treatment centre. It was a “brilliant idea,” she said, and "would save a lot of people\'s lives". Data for 2023 revealed that 1,172 people died - an increase of 121 on the previous 12 months.   Xylazine is not approved for use in humans and has caused fatal overdoses in the US. It will involve users taking their own illegal drugs in a hygienic environment under supervision. Hugh shows the BBC where he goes to use drugs as the UK\'s first consumption room was approved. The safe consumption room pilot in Glasgow will be the first to be sanctioned in the UK.

At least, not this year, under these circumstances. But if anyone knows how quickly fortunes can change, it’s this president – whose personal and professional life has been scarred by tragedy and adversity. Speaking to a packed arena in Chicago on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, Mr Biden offered a full-throated defence of his presidency – touching on many of the themes that he campaigned on in 2020 and again this year before abandoning his re-election bid in mid-July, a few weeks after a catastrophic debate performance. "Like many of you, I gave my heart and soul to this nation,” he said, towards the end of a nearly hour-long address punctuated by raucous shouts of "Thank you, Joe". Mr Biden had walked out onto the stage after being introduced by his daughter Ashley and wife, Jill, who told the audience she "saw him dig deep into his soul" when he decided to exit the presidential race. After hugging Ashley, he put a tissue to his eyes to dab away the tears. The president touched his heart, and stood a little straighter at the lectern, flashing a toothy smile as the crowd continued to cheer. His speech had a keen eye on his place in history but he spent time singing the praises of his vice-president - the woman he hopes will succeed him in the White House. “Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee and it\'s the best decision I made my whole career,” he said. “She\'s tough, she\'s experienced, and she has enormous integrity.” Unlike his Oval Office address four weeks ago, Mr Biden did not speak directly of passing the torch to a new generation - but the message was clear enough. After the president concluded his remarks, Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff came out to embrace Mr Biden and his wife, Jill. “I love you,” the vice-president mouthed to Mr Biden after their hug. While Mr Biden spent much of the end of his speech focusing on Ms Harris – a tacit acknowledgment that how she fares against Donald Trump in November\'s vote could make or break how history, and his party, remembers him - many of the evening’s earlier speakers directed their tributes to the current White House resident. It started with a planned – but unannounced – appearance by Ms Harris herself, who took the stage to thunderous applause. “Joe, thank you for your historic leadership and for your lifetime of service to our nation and for all you continue to do,” she said. “We are forever grateful to you.”  Later, Delaware Senator Chris Coons – one of Mr Biden’s closest allies – took his turn singing the president’s praises. “I’ve never known a more compassionate man than Joe Biden,” he said. “I’ve never known a man who has taken from his own loss and his own faith and delivered so much for the future of so many others.” Hillary Clinton offered her own tribute when she appeared on stage earlier in the evening, telling the crowd that Mr Biden had "brought dignity, decency and competence back to the White House". The 2016 Democratic nominee received an extended ovation, and she noted that while she did not break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” by becoming the first woman president, “on the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office”. The reception Mr Biden received from the packed Democratic convention hall was equally electric. The Democrats here in Chicago have been jubilant all day. But the cheers for the president could be as much a sign of gratitude for his grudging decision to step aside as it was a tribute to a storied political career that began in 1972 when he was first elected to Congress at the age of 29. Tomorrow, Barack Obama will address the convention crowd. On Wednesday, Bill Clinton will have his turn. Both are former presidents who stood for – and won – re-election. Mr Biden will not have that opportunity. Instead, he was left to define and defend his legacy as a one-term president in a speech that, barring a major national event in the next five months, will be his final address to a massive American television audience. Toward the end of the speech, he quoted a line from a song, American Anthem. “Let me know in my heart when my days are through, that America, America, I gave my best to you,” he said. The crowd erupted in another round of applause. Eight years ago, Mr Biden passed up a presidential bid in favour of Mrs Clinton – under some not so subtle pressure from Mr Obama. Four years ago, he won the nomination, but the Covid pandemic denied him an opportunity to bask in adulation of a packed Democratic convention hall and the celebratory post-speech balloon drop. This, then, was as close to a Democratic convention moment in the spotlight Mr Biden will get. After his speech concluded – past midnight on the US east coast - the president left the arena and headed to Air Force One for a flight to California for a holiday. His time in Chicago, at this Democratic National Convention, was measured in hours, not days. And despite his desires just a few months ago, his remaining time as president will be measured in months, not years.

The vice-president made a surprise appearance on the first night at the Democratic convention. Federal agencies say Iran was trying "to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions". Taylor Swift has yet to weigh in on the 2024 election, but endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020.  Katty Kay says Biden will use speech to defend his legacy and pass the torch - then he\'ll go on holiday. Copyright 2024 BBC.

All athletes take them. It\'s really nothing special." That was what German heptathlete Birgit Dressel, who finished ninth in the 1984 Olympic Games, once told her mother. Sadly, those words couldn\'t have been further from the truth. On 8 April 1987, after taking medication to help with a bad back, Dressel\'s body went into allergic-toxic shock, leading to rapid organ failure.  After two days of agony in Mainz hospital, she died at the age of 26. Her autopsy revealed traces of more than 100 drugs in her system, including anabolic steroids that she had been taking for years, while her medical history showed she had been injected with at least 40 different substances throughout her career, with one practitioner alone administering 400 injections. During her final years, she became heavily reliant on prescription drugs to compete and live pain-free. Her tortuous training regime had pushed her body to the brink, and by the time of her death, she was experiencing hip pain, lateral bending of the spinal column, damage to the discs and fusion of the spinal vertebrae, displacement of the pelvis, degeneration of both kneecaps and sunken arches in her feet.  To combat the pain, she was reportedly taking nine pills a day, as well as additional drugs administered by three separate doctors. Dressel\'s demise was a harrowing example of how far humans will go to keep up, but her story had much broader implications. After the reunification of Germany in 1990, a treasure trove of documents held by the then-defunct East German secret police, the Stasi, revealed what many had suspected for decades: East Germany had conducted a state-sponsored, systematic doping operation that led to spectacular sporting success. As the sordid details were gradually revealed, Western European nations appeared vindicated.  Allegations of East Germany doping, along with other Soviet satellite states, had increased dramatically throughout the 1980s. Here was confirmation the other side had been cheating all along. However, the narrative was not quite so simple. The division between \'clean\' and \'dirty\' athletes was not as well-defined as the line that had cut Germany in half for nearly 50 years. Dressel, born in Bremen and living in Mainz, was not from East Germany but from the West. While they would take decades to emerge, West German sport had its own secrets. Ines Geipel (far left, bib number 166) competing in 1985. On the far right, in bib number seven, is Marita Koch, another East German athlete whose 39-year-old 400m record still stands today "From the 1970s onwards, East Germany began winning a lot of medals. West German politicians started worrying about it and spreading the message that West German athletes needed to win medals too," says Letizia Paoli, who chaired the 2009 committee investigating West German doping activity at the University of Freiburg. "They couldn\'t afford to look worse than the East. Medals were seen as an indicator of political and economic success." The East German doping system was comprehensive, systematic and all-encompassing. Stasi files revealed that an initially amateurish doping programme was transformed in 1974 by an innocuous-sounding piece of policy called State Research Plan 14.25. It mandated doping across all sports with the potential to deliver Olympic glory. Thousands of athletes, some as young as 12, were shovelled through a programme where cheating was a prerequisite. "The training regime was really tough. We trained three times a day, and when we weren\'t training we did physiotherapy, sauna and yoga to recover. We were like well-bred horses waiting to race," says Ines Geipel, a former East German athlete and author of a book, Behind The Wall, which details her experience in Cold War East Germany. "As young people, sport was the only way for us to see the world - to get out. "We were given various tablets in silver foil, but there was no information about them, just that they were good to take because we sweated so much while competing." Thanks to recovered documents, Geipel now knows she was primarily being given an anabolic steroid called oral turinabol. Refusals or questioning led to the withdrawal of athletic sponsorship and a black mark against your name in Stasi files. That, in turn, could affect your chances of gaining employment, housing or benefits. Geipel felt the full weight of the Stasi when officials uncovered her plans to defect and remain in Los Angeles after the 1984 Olympics to be with a Mexican athlete she had fallen in love with. After returning to East Germany, the Stasi turned the screw, she was expelled from sport and, for many of her compatriots, became a social pariah. "If you escaped, you were seen as a traitor," said Geipel. "Firstly, they wanted to find a man in the GDR [East Germany] who looked like the Mexican I\'d fallen in love with. "They thought if I met a man who looked like the Mexican, then everything would be good again. There wasn\'t such a man. "Then they tried to force me to commit to the Stasi. But I didn\'t do it. "The last stage, when they didn\'t see any other option, was to operate on me and cut through my stomach. "It\'s all in the files... they cut the stomach in such a way, through all the muscles and everything so that I couldn\'t run any more and didn\'t have a way of getting to the rest of the world any more." In August 1989, she fled to the West via Hungary after crawling across the heavily-defended border. Geipel, pictured in 2014, asked for her name to be removed from the German record books after she was part of a quartet who set a national 4x100m record. An asterisk now appears in its place It is possible to pick up the threads of Germany\'s recent doping past and follow them back decades. Plenty lead to the Western side of the Cold War. The day before the 2006 Tour de France,  a doping scandal exploded. German rider Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour winner and one of that year\'s favourites, was sitting on a bus on the way to a press conference when he received the news that his world was about to come down around him. Operation Puerto, an investigation by Spanish police into doping in sport, had connected him to illegal blood transfusion.  The investigation\'s details were scandalous: Manolo Saiz, the directeur sportif of the Liberty Segurosâ\x80\x93Wurth team, was arrested with a briefcase of cash in Madrid. The Spaniard was never charged, but neither did he ever return to the top level of professional cycling.  Elsewhere a fridge filled with 186 blood bags, labelled with codenames belonging to athletes, was discovered at doctor Eufemiano Fuentes\' clinic, along with complex machines to manipulate and transfuse blood. Investigations into his German-based T Mobile team later uncovered more than a decade\'s worth of doping starting in the early 1990s, when it was known as Telekom. Ullrich, seen here in the wake of his 2006 suspension from the Tour de France, has said that not blood doping during his era would have been "like going to a gunfight armed only with a knife" Two team doctors, Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich, admitted their involvement in long-term doping. "I made available to cyclists, upon request, drug substances, especially EPO [erythropoietin, a hormone that causes the body to make more red blood cells]," said Schmid, claiming in his defence that he had never doped an unwitting athlete. Both men came from one university department: the University Medical Center Freiburg, in south-west Germany, just 20 miles from the French border. The University of Freiburg responded by forming an independent committee to look into historic doping allegations. The first commission was quickly dissolved due to health reasons, while Paoli, an Italian criminologist, was asked to chair the second and head a six-strong team of investigators. She accepted, but her and her team\'s relationship with the university soon deteriorated. All six of the investigators resigned in protest at the lack of cooperation from the university and its departments, but ultimately did publish an independent report. It painted a damning picture of decades of doping by medics based at Freiburg. Two men were cited as key players: professors Joseph Keul and Armin Klumper. From the 1960s onwards, Keul, who died in 2000, was the superstar physician in Germany, working with scores of top-level athletes and acting for more than 20 years as head physician of the German Olympic team. Keul started providing medical care for West German Olympic teams in 1960 Klumper joined Freiburg in the mid-1960s, initially as a medical assistant, before becoming head of sports traumatology. "Unlike in East Germany, where it was a top-down doping system, in the West, much of it was outsourced to Freiburg," says Paoli. According to sources seen by the commission, as many as 90% of West German track and field athletes during the 1970s and 1980s passed through Freiburg - though how many doped may never be known.  What is clear is that Keul and Klumper played vital roles in West Germany\'s and then Germany\'s sporting successes. "The athletes loved Klumper. He was excellent with his diagnostics and would go to the track and field to spend a lot of time with them, while Keul was more hands-off," says Paoli. Evidence of Klumper\'s involvement in doping is staggering. His infamous \'Klumper cocktails\' were referenced multiple times during interviews with ex-athletes. "These were mixtures of off-label medicines, prescription medicines, doping products and natural remedies that were supposedly tailored to individual athletes\' needs," says Paoli. One such athlete was Dressel, who visited Klumper regularly for treatment. Her last visit to Freiburg came on 24 February 1987 - less than three months before her death - where he reportedly gave her a cocktail containing 15 substances. By the late 1980s, numerous West German sporting figures, including discus thrower Alwin Wagner, external and sprinter Manfred Ommer,, external were openly linking Klumper, who died in 2019, with historic doping. Yet he also had his supporters. Even as his name began to sink under further allegations in 1997, a passionate defence was published in a national newspaper, signed by some major names in German sport at the time, including gymnast Eberhard Gienger, decathlete Jurgen Hingsen and footballer Wolfgang Overath. Gienger subsequently admitted in 2006 that he had taken anabolic steroids, external during his career, saying he doped to aid his recovery after an operation and that Klumper "prescribed very generously".  Hingsen insisted in 2016 that Klumper and Keul had never offered him anything illicit, external. Overath has since described any suggestion of doping during his time in elite sport as \'absurd\'., external Hingsen in discussion with Klumper (right) in the summer of 1988. Hingsen committed three false starts in the 100m - the opening event of the competition - in the Olympic decathlon in Seoul later that year, ending his hopes of a medal Olympic medal-winning hammer thrower Uwe Beyer presented a prescription for steroids bearing Keul\'s name, but, overall, direct evidence linking Klumper\'s colleague with doping was less widespread. Keul instead worked to undermine the growing evidence of the health risks of drug misuse and the anti-doping system designed to catch cheats. In 1976, he gave an interview explaining how he justified his stance to himself and others. "Where is it written that we should prevent harm?" Keul said to German broadcaster ZDF. "That is a general medical task, but it has nothing to do with sports medicine." For him, healthy sportspeople gambling on performance enhancement was a separate branch of medicine, one where the usual considerations did not apply. In 1992, with public funds drying up after the end of the Cold War, Keul began taking large amounts from external sources, including Deutsche Telekom\'s cycling team, which later became T-Mobile. The narrative of a virtuous West Germany emerging victorious from sport\'s Cold War was dented when T-Mobile and Keul\'s Freiburg colleagues were caught up in the Tour de France doping scandal in 2006. In August 2013, it was fatally shattered. Alwin Wagner finished sixth at the Los Angeles 1984 Olympics, but said Armin Klumper stopped doping him after those Games as he continued to criticise and question the drugs regimes that West Germany\'s elite athletes undertook A report commissioned by the German Ministry of Sport and carried out by researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin and the University of Munster - Leaks from Doping in Germany from 1950 to Today - appeared in various German newspapers. The report was heavily redacted because of legal and privacy concerns, but was clear enough in its claim that doping was widespread on both sides of the Cold War divide and had continued after reunification. The revelations on West German doping landed like a bombshell, with the reverberations travelling around the world. The report alleged that West Germany\'s shock comeback win over Hungary in the 1954 World Cup final - a game often called \'The Miracle of Bern\' - had been powered by pervitin, an energy-boosting methamphetamine. The drug had been studied in depth for its doping qualities at Freiburg during the 1950s. Questions were also raised over West Germany\'s 1966 World Cup, in which they reached the final but lost to England 4-2. The report revealed that a letter from Fifa official Mihailo Andrejevic informed the president of the German Athletics Association, Max Danz, that "fine traces" of ephedrine - a central nervous system stimulant - were found in three players of the German national team.  No action was taken and some have speculated that the players may have consumed the ephedrine in a cold medicine. By the time of the 1972 and 1976 Olympics, in Munich and Montreal respectively, organised doping was common among West Germany\'s elite athletes, the report added. While most of Germany\'s sports federations agreed to take part and share documentation, according to the report, it was notable that the country\'s athletic association refused to hand over the minutes of its presidential meetings, while "a former president of the federation was unwilling to allow access to doping-related documents in his possession". The report also states that the German Football Association only offered the researchers access under ultimately unacceptable conditions, while the security services refused access to potential doping-related documents from both West and East Germany. Over a decade later, the initial report, even with redactions, is only available as a physical copy by request to the German government.  The Federal Institute for Sports Science (BISp) said the 804-page initial report did not "meet the requirements of good scientific work in form and content" and requested that it was revised. A later, 43-page version has been made available more publicly., external The University of Freiburg told BBC Sport it was "committed to the consistent, unreserved and transparent clarification of the past surrounding Freiburg sports medicine" and described the resignation of Paoli and her team of investigators and their failure to deliver a final report in conjunction with it as "very regrettable". The university has made some parts of the team\'s provisional work available online., external Germany announced in July, external that it intends to bid to host the 2040 Olympic and Paralympic Games. If successful, the event would mark 50 years since reunification. But, like the future, the country\'s past is contested. The Cold War had its victor, and victors often have the freedom to mould history and storylines as they see fit. Yet West Germany\'s secrets have, at least partially, emerged to change the script. East Germany doped its athletes on a chillingly industrial level that saw thousands drugged without clear consent to gain a sporting upper hand - but the situation in the West was far less opaque. Those in West Germany were afforded freedom beyond the wildest dreams of East Germans, but it is becoming increasingly clear that many chose exactly the same methods as the enemy.  For some, in the battle for Cold War medals, anything to gain an advantage was fair game.

The EastEnders star will be one of Channel 4\'s hosts of the Paralympic Games, which begin in Paris next week. Ayling-Ellis will host a daily show, Afternoon Live, alongside Clare Balding from the Athletes\' Village, with live British Sign Language (BSL) signing. The actress said the Paralympics was "a great opportunity to show people what us disabled people can do". For the opening and closing ceremonies, Balding will be joined by broadcaster and former wheelchair basketball player Ade Adepitan and Paralympic swimming champion Ellie Simmonds. Channel 4\'s presenting line-up will also feature former rugby union player Ed Jackson, racing driver-turned-pundit Billy Monger, BBC Radio 1 presenter Vick Hope, and comedian Josh Pugh. Ayling-Ellis said the Paralympics "breaks people\'s barriers of understanding what we are capable of".  "Really, though," she added, "we shouldn\'t be trying to prove this to people." "It is really exciting that I am the first deaf person to host a live sports TV show. People seem to think that hosting a show is also to do with hearing, but now I\'m here to prove that doesn\'t have to be." The 29-year-old said she has had "lots of training" before taking on her first hosting job. "I didn\'t realise how hard it is," she said. "I did panic a bit and think, what have I signed up for? "But I really love it. I\'m really enjoying it. I\'m so excited to be doing it." Ayling-Ellis joined EastEnders in 2020, and became the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing the following year. She left EastEnders in 2022. She was also the first person to deliver a CBeebies bedtime story in sign language. "My career so far has been quite mad, and this is another job for me to challenge myself really," she continued. "It is such a big challenge. No-one deaf has ever done this before. I think I\'m addicted to being the first of doing something, and that is what I want to do." Ayling-Ellis said that, when she talks to the Paralympians, she does not "want it to become an inspirational story so everyone else feels better about their lives". "It\'s for everyone to learn from and understand more about disability and that this is all just normal." Ayling-Ellis was also the first deaf person to deliver the Alternative MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival, and helped launch the first deaf Barbie. Last year, she made her West End debut in the Shakespearean romantic comedy As You Like It, being nominated for an Olivier Award for her performance. Balding, who has presented Wimbledon and the Olympics this year, called the Paralympics the "peak of the summer of sport". She noted that a lot of live presenting is reliant on talkback, the system that allows directors and editors to communicate with on-screen presenters through an earpiece. "So we\'re finding different ways of doing things like that and it\'s so important to take on that challenge and take new steps," Balding said. "When Paralympic athletes like Jonnie Peacock, Ellie Simmonds, Jodie Cundy or Lauren Steadman have appeared on Strictly, the first question has been \'Well, how?\' And now, with Rose, [to] work on a live programme, you might say, \'How is a deaf presenter going to?\' "We\'re going to show you. We\'re not going to tell you how, we\'re going to show you." Channel 4\'s coverage of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games will begin with the opening ceremony on 28 August, with the closing ceremony on 8 September. The winners will be announced at a ceremony at London\'s O2 Arena on 11 September. Across a career spanning several decades, Donahue was considered the "king of daytime talk". The 36-year-old will follow up her award-winning drama I May Destroy You with First Day On Earth. The TV watchdog decides not to investigate the complaints, which it says involved bullying and racism. A couple want to raise £70,000 to fund a play area nearer their Northamptonshire home.
