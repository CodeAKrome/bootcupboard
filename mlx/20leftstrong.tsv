Turkey's president says the probe tackles what he calls a corrupt network that is like "an octopus whose arms stretch to other parts of Turkey and abroad." The investigation, which began in Istanbul but has spread across the country, has targetted only municipalities run by the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, the party of modern Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The CHP denies the corruption allegations and calls them a naked attempt to eliminate a democratic alternative for Turks, a charge the government refutes.  The crackdown tightens Erdogan's two-decade grip on power at a time that Turkey's influence in the Middle East and Europe has grown. For this reason, diplomats and analysts say, it has garnered only muted criticism from Western allies as a threat to democracy even as street protests erupted in the spring. According to the review of legal filings and state disclosures, 14 elected CHP mayors, including Istanbul's Ekrem Imamoglu - Erdogan's main rival - and more than 200 party members or local officials have been jailed pending trial.  Not since a series of coups in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s have such high-profile political leaders been removed from office on the basis of as yet unpublished evidence, which suspects' lawyers dismiss as fabricated. "These investigations are being used as a tool for political attrition rather than objective investigation of concrete events," said Ertugrul Gunay, a former culture and tourism minister in Erdogan's cabinets between 2007 and 2013. He resigned from the ruling AK Party (AKP) after thousands of Turks were arrested over the anti-government Gezi Park protests of 2013. The latest legal drive, though smaller in scale, has gone further in targetting a would-be future government, riding high in the polls.  It reflects "anxiety and panic that (Erdogan's) ruling party has for the next elections," Gunay told Reuters.  Erdogan and his ministers have repeatedly rejected as unfounded critics' accusations of judicial interference, saying the independent courts need time to sort through evidence.  They say such criticism reflects an opposition party reckoning with its illegal practices and internal strife, and undermines public trust.   "This is a legal process, not a political one. We are not involved in any aspect of this process," Erdogan told his AKP MPs in parliament on Wednesday. MORE THAN 220 IMPRISONED  At the centre of the investigation is Imamoglu, mayor of Istanbul's 17 million people, who was jailed in March pending a court hearing on corruption charges he denies.  He is the CHP presidential candidate in any future election, and his arrest sparked the biggest protests since Gezi and a sharp lira selloff, both of which have since abated.  But beyond Imamoglu - who from behind bars still leads Erdogan in some polls - the Reuters review found that more than 500 people were detained and questioned since the probe began in October last year, including at least 202 since last week alone.  Of those, more than 220 were imprisoned or put under house arrest, according to the review, which was based in part on a compilation of reports by state-run Anadolu Agency.  Erdogan's office and the Justice Ministry did not respond this week to a detailed request for a tally of detentions and arrests, and for a comment on the Reuters review's findings.  Reuters further found that at least 36 people, mostly those in the private sector doing business with municipalities, provided a second statement to prosecutors from prison under the "effective repentance" provision of Turkish law - after which 32 of them were released from prison under judicial control measures. These statements have identified more suspects, disclosures from prosecutors and others show. Since Tuesday last week the investigation has spread to Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, as well as Antalya, Adana and Adiyaman - all won by the centrist CHP over Erdogan's ruling conservative AKP in last year's March municipal elections, the party's biggest ever electoral defeat.  TENTACLES Erdogan has in recent months predicted, correctly, that more charges and detentions were to come, further stoking concerns over political interference.  Days after his octopus comment in May, five district mayors from Istanbul and Adana were arrested on corruption charges.  Erdogan's office and the Justice Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on critics' claims that authorities' public comments about the probe harm judicial independence, and that it unfairly targets only the CHP for political gain.  Turkey's Directorate of Communications released a list of past AKP mayors who were convicted on similar charges in separate probes, saying claims that the CHP is exclusively targetted are "entirely unfounded". Most of those listed were investigated after leaving office and were not jailed pending trial.  The Reuters review of the latest probe shows no legal actions were taken in the 14 of Istanbul's 39 districts run by the AKP.  Mehmet Pehlivan, Imamoglu's lawyer who was also jailed last month on criminal-membership charges he denies, told Reuters from prison that the investigation seeks for the first time to criminalise the right to practice law and to a legal defence.  He said the mayor faces "not a single concrete piece of evidence". Prosecutors have not yet issued indictments.  In one window into the probe, a 121-page transcript of police questioning seen by Reuters shows that Imamoglu faced one claim that he colluded with a group of men who allegedly met at a cafe to discuss bribe payments.  Police asked how his phone connected to the same cellular tower as those of the men at least 150 times, the documents show. He responded that his home at the time was close to the cafe so his phone would naturally use the same tower.  A spokesman for the prosecutor did not immediately comment on the police questioning.  The CHP has rejected all corruption allegations against its municipal officials but has said it will investigate after Turkey's TRT state broadcaster released footage of the deputy mayor of Manavgat, in the southern Antalya province, allegedly accepting bribes.  FUTURE ELECTION  Turkey has in the past seen waves of mass arrests of pro-Kurdish leaders, civil society members, military officers and outlawed groups, especially during Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian tenure.  The CHP had been relatively spared in the Erdogan era, in which it lost a string of elections to his AKP since 2002. Though the next presidential vote is not scheduled until 2028, it will need to come sooner if Erdogan wants to run again. He could also seek to amend the constitutional two-term limit.  The CHP mayors, including 14 in jail and one under house arrest, all deny the corruption, bribery and terrorism-related charges for which they await a court decision. Some have been suspended from duty.  CHP Chairman Ozgur Ozel said the mayors "have fallen prisoner to this coup against Ataturk's party" in a speech on Sunday, that itself prompted a separate probe on charges including insulting the president.

REUTERS/Umit Bektas/File Photo  Published Jul 10, 2025, 02:02 PM Updated Jul 10, 2025, 02:02 PM ISTANBUL - Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) faces a wave of charges of corruption, insulting officials and terrorism links that has left hundreds of its members and municipal workers, including 14 mayors, detained or jailed.  Here are some details on the crackdown: WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR? HOW HAS TURKEY REACTED? Hundreds of people have been detained or jailed as part of the legal crackdown that has been criticised as anti-democratic and politicised by opposition parties, right groups and some foreign leaders - claims the government denies saying the judiciary is independent.  The arrest in March of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on corruption charges sparked the country's largest street protests in a decade.  It also prompted a brief but sharp selloff in the lira and other Turkish assets, leading the central bank to reverse a monetary easing cycle. Prosecutors have not issued indictments and the CHP says the charges are fabricated.  WHO ARE THE KEY FIGURES? Mayor Imamoglu, who is President Tayyip Erdogan's main rival and leads him in some polls, was detained on graft charges he denies. The two-term mayor defeated candidates from Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP) in 2019 and 2024, when the CHP swept most big cities across the country in the AKP's biggest ever electoral defeat. Though now behind bars, he is the centrist CHP's presidential candidate in any future election against the conservative AKP. Erdogan, Turkey's leader of 22 years, says the probe needs to address a vast network of corruption and has urged patience. The probe tightens his grip on power at a time that he could seek a way to stand for office again, despite his having reached a term limit. The next presidential vote is set for 2028 but will need to come earlier if he is to run again.  Ozgur Ozel, chairman of the CHP, has led the anti-Erdogan rallies since Imamoglu was arrested, calling the crackdown a "coup attempt" to hamstring the government's rival. A potential alternative CHP presidential candidate, Ozel faces a court ruling set for September on another case that could strip him of his title and annul his party's congress in 2023.  WHEN DID THE CRACKDOWN BEGIN? The crackdown began on October 31, 2024, when a court jailed, pending trial, Ahmet Ozer, the CHP mayor of Istanbul's Esenyurt district, on charges of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group. It expanded in January when Riza Akpolat, mayor of the city's Besiktas district, was jailed in an investigation into an alleged criminal organisation suspected of rigging public tenders by bribing public officials. HOW HAS IT EXPANDED? On March 18, Imamoglu entered the spotlight when Istanbul University annuled his university degree over irregularities, days before he was to be picked CHP presidential candidate - for which a degree is a pre-condition. The next morning, police detained him and about 100 others. Protests over his detention spread, and on March 23 a court jailed the mayor on the same day that CHP members and non-members endorsed him as presidential candidate. On March 27, the number of people detained in anti-government protests neared 1,900. Ankara denounced opposition calls for a mass commercial boycott, describing them as an economic "sabotage attempt". On April 30, a court jailed 18 Istanbul municipality officials on corruption charges in a further widening of the crackdown. On May 20, police detained 18 more municipality employees, then on May 31, prosecutors issued detention warrants for 47 people in four separate investigations including mayors in the CHP-run southern province of Adana. On July 1, the investigation exploded across the country when a total of 157 people were ordered detained on corruption, tender rigging and fraud charges in the western coastal city of Izmir, including a CHP lawmaker and a former mayor. Of those, 35 people were jailed pending trial. On July 4, the mayor of Manavgat was detained and the following day, July 5, three more mayors and several others were detained in the big southern cities of Adana, Adiyaman and Antalya.

PHOTO: AFP Published Jul 10, 2025, 11:55 AM Updated Jul 10, 2025, 11:59 AM TIRABIN AL-SANA, Israel - At the end of a dusty road in southern Israel, beyond a Bedouin village of unfinished houses and the shiny dome of a mosque, a field of solar panels gleams in the hot desert sun. Tirabin al-Sana in Israel’s Negev desert is the home of the Tirabin (also spelled Tarabin) Bedouin tribe, who signed a contract with an Israeli solar energy company to build the installation. The deal has helped provide jobs for the community as well as promote cleaner, cheaper energy for the country, as the power produced is pumped into the national grid. Earlier this month, the Al-Ghanami family in the town of Abu Krinat a little further south inaugurated a similar field of solar panels.   Bedouin families have for years tried and failed to hold on to their lands, coming up against right-wing groups and hardline government officials. Demolition orders issued by Israeli authorities plague Bedouin villages, threatening the traditionally semi-nomadic communities with forced eviction.  This aerial view shows solar panels at an electricity-generation plant for the Bedouin community in the village of Tirabin al-Sana in Israel’s southern Negev Desert, on June 11. PHOTO: AFP But Yosef Abramowitz, co-chair of the non-profit organisation Shamsuna, said solar field projects help them to stake a more definitive claim. “It secures their land rights forever,” he told AFP. “It’s the only way to settle the Bedouin land issue and secure 100 percent renewable energy,” he added, calling it a “win, win”. For the solar panels to be built, the land must be registered as part of the Bedouin village, strengthening their claim over it. Roughly 300,000 Bedouins live in the Negev desert, half of them in places such as Tirabin al-Sana, including some 110,000 who reside in villages not officially recognised by the government.  Villages that are not formally recognised are fighting the biggest battle to stay on the land. Far-right groups, some backed by the current government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have stepped up efforts in the past two years to drive these families away. A sharp increase in home demolitions has left the communities vulnerable and whole families without a roof over their heads. “Since 2023, more than 8,500 buildings have been demolished in these unrecognised villages,” Marwan Abu Frieh, from the legal aid organisation Adalah, told AFP at a recent protest in Beersheva, the largest city in the Negev. “Within these villages, thousands of families are now living out in the open, an escalation the Negev has not witnessed in perhaps the last two decades.” Tribes just want to “live in peace and dignity”, following their distinct customs and traditions, he said. This aerial view shows photovoltaic solar panels in the yard of a kindergarten in the recognised but unplanned Bedouin village of Umm Batin near Beersheva in Israel’s southern Negev Desert, on June 11. PHOTO: AFP Gil Yasur, who also works with Shamsuna developing critical infrastructure in Bedouin villages, said land claims issues were common among Bedouins across the Negev. Families who include a solar project on their land, however, stand a better chance of securing it, he added. “Then everyone will benefit – the landowners, the country, the Negev,” he said. “This is the best way to move forward to a green economy.” In Um Batin, a recognised village, residents are using solar energy in a different way – to power a local kindergarten all year round. Until last year, the village relied on power from a diesel generator that polluted the air and the ground where the children played. Now, a hulking solar panel shields the children from the sun as its surface sucks up the powerful rays, keeping the kindergarten in full working order. Children sit in the classroom of a kindergarten powered by photovoltaic solar panels in the recognised but unplanned Bedouin village of Umm Batin near Beersheva in Israel’s southern Negev Desert. PHOTO: AFP “It was not clean or comfortable here before,” said Nama Abu Kaf, who works in the kindergarten. “Now we have air conditioning and a projector so the children can watch television.”    Hani al-Hawashleh, who oversees the project on behalf of Shamsuna, said the solar energy initiative for schools and kindergartens was “very positive”. “Without power you can’t use all kinds of equipment such as projectors, lights in the classrooms and, on the other hand, it saves costs and uses clean energy,” he said. The projects are part of a pilot scheme run by Shamsuna.  Asked if there was interest in expanding to other educational institutions that rely on polluting generators, he said there were challenges and bureaucracy but he hoped to see more. “We need people to collaborate with us to move this forward,” he said, adding that he would “love to see a solar energy system in every village”.

PHOTO: AFP Summary AI generated Published Jul 10, 2025, 11:21 AM Updated Jul 10, 2025, 11:21 AM WASHINGTON - One of the US Senate’s leading climate advocates says President Donald Trump’s administration no longer governs – it “occupies” the nation on behalf of Big Oil. In an interview, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island blamed the sweeping rollback of environmental protections on a flood of unlimited, anonymous corporate political spending, and said exposing the scale of this “fraud” is key to breaking its grip. His remarks came as the death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas linked by scientists to climate change threatened to surge further.  catastrophic flooding in Texas “This isn’t even government any longer,” the 69-year-old told a small group of reporters ahead of an address to Congress on July 9 – his 300th so-called “Time to Wake Up” speech, delivered as activists reel from Mr Trump’s actions. “This is an occupying force from the fossil fuel industry that has injected itself into the key positions of responsibility,” said the lawmaker. “It has the appearance of being government – they ride around in the black cars... they have the offices, they have the titles,” he said. But in reality, “they’re fossil fuel flunkies... and they care not a whit for public opinion or public safety.”   Big Oil spent at least US$445 million (S$570 million) to help elect Mr Trump, according to a recent analysis by Climate Power, which said its figure was likely a vast underestimate because of undisclosed donations.                   In his second term, the Republican president has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, gutted science agencies, fired researchers and forecasters, scrapped his predecessor Joe Biden’s clean energy tax cuts and rolled back powerplant and vehicle efficiency standards. Senator Whitehouse calls it the oil, coal and gas industry’s “most sordid dreams come true” and says the stage was set by the 2010 Supreme Court “Citizens United” ruling, which unleashed an era of unchecked corporate political spending. A former state attorney-general who battled corporate polluters, he recalled that when he first joined the Senate, climate bipartisanship flourished: John McCain, the GOP’s 2008 presidential nominee, had “a perfectly respectable climate platform,” while Republican senators proposed bills. “These weren’t little tiddlywinks, nibble-at-the-edges bills,” he recalled, but would have genuinely changed the trajectory of climate emissions. Citizens United reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and opened the floodgates to dark money. “They were able to come into the Republican Party and say, ‘We will give you unlimited amounts of money. You will have more money in your elections than you’ve ever seen before’.”                   Despite the bleak landscape, Senator Whitehouse still sees a narrow path to climate safety - and points to several potential game changers. First, he cites the possible emergence of a global carbon pricing effort, spearheaded by the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which taxes importers based on their climate footprint. Countries like Britain, Canada, Mexico and Australia could join this movement, creating a de facto global price on carbon, enforced through trade – without US legislation. Second, he says, Democrats can and must expose fossil fuel’s stranglehold on the Republican party, a phenomenon he calls one of the “most grave incidents of political corruption and fraud that the country has ever seen”, and pass a bill forcing donor transparency. Third, what was once framed as a crisis for polar bears – and later as an opportunity for green jobs – is today directly hitting Americans where it hurts most: their wallets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that climate change will shrink mortgage availability across swaths of the United States in the coming years as banks and insurers retreat from fire- and flood-prone regions. Risks could cascade from an insurance crunch into a broader mortgage collapse – potentially triggering a 2008-style crash.  Senator Whitehouse predicts the fossil fuel industry’s hold on Republicans won’t last forever.  “When it becomes clear what has been done here, then there’s going to be a dramatic reset,” he said. “A reckoning will come for this. There’s no doubt about it – it’s just the nature of human affairs.” Mr Trump himself, he added, was merely swept along by the dominant current of the post-2010 Republican Party, with no ideological stake in the issue.  As recently as 2009, he co-signed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times demanding stronger climate action from then president Barack Obama.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Jul 10, 2025, 06:17 AM Updated Jul 10, 2025, 12:01 PM WASHINGTON - The United States said on July 9 that it was imposing sanctions on Ms Francesca Albanese, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, who has been very critical of US ally Israel’s war in Gaza. very critical of US ally Israel’s war in Gaza “Today I am imposing sanctions on UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for her illegitimate and shameful efforts to prompt (International Criminal Court) action against US and Israeli officials, companies, and executives,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. In a post on X late on July 9, Ms Albanese wrote that she stood “firmly and convincingly on the side of justice, as I have always done”, without directly mentioning the US sanctions. In a text message to Al Jazeera, she was quoted as dismissing the US move as “mafia style intimidation techniques”.  Ms Albanese, an Italian lawyer and academic, has called on states at the UN Human Rights Council to impose an arms embargo and cut off trade and financial ties with Israel while accusing the US ally of waging a “genocidal campaign” in Gaza. Israel has faced accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice and of war crimes at the ICC over its devastating military assault on Gaza. Israel denies the accusations and says its campaign amounts to self-defense after a deadly October 2023 Hamas attack. In a report published earlier in July, Ms Albanese accused over 60 companies, including major arms manufacturers and technology firms, of involvement in supporting Israeli settlements and military actions in Gaza. The report called on companies to cease dealings with Israel and for legal accountability for executives implicated in alleged violations of international law. Ms Albanese is one of dozens of independent human rights experts mandated by the United Nations to report on specific themes and crises. The views expressed by special rapporteurs do not reflect those of the global body as a whole. Rights experts slammed the US sanctions against Ms Albanese. Mr Dylan Williams, vice-president for government affairs at the Centre for International Policy think tank, labeled them as “rogue state behavior” while Amnesty International said special rapporteurs must be supported and not sanctioned. “Governments around the world and all actors who believe in the rule-based order and international law must do everything in their power to mitigate and block the effect of the sanctions against Francesca Albanese and more generally to protect the work and independence of Special Rapporteurs,” Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard, a former UN special rapporteur, said. Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has stopped US engagement with the UN Human Rights Council, extended a halt to funding for the Palestinian relief agency UNRWA and ordered a review of the UN cultural agency Unesco.  He has also announced US plans to quit the Paris climate deal and the World Health Organisation. His administration imposed sanctions on four judges at the ICC in June in retaliation over the war tribunal’s issuance of an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a past decision to open a case into alleged war crimes by US troops in Afghanistan.

The discussion of geopolitical issues and diplomatic relations also aligns with perspectives often found in left-leaning or critical international relations studies.

Looking for partners to help it meet its decarbonisation targets, the Moroccan phosphate giant is in advanced discussions with the US company.                             After losing influence in the United States under the presidency of Bouteflika and at the end of his reign, Algiers is reactivating its networks in the energy sector.                             Announced with great fanfare at the beginning of May, the agreement between Agence Française de Développement and the phosphate giant OCP Group should also benefit French group Engie.                             President William Ruto is quietly repositioning Kenya in the Western Sahara dispute, edging closer to Rabat's camp as fertiliser diplomacy and economic interests take priority over long-standing support for the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, which has an embassy in Nairobi.                             Morocco's economic success of recent years is under threat from recurring drought. Delays in various plans to ensure sustainable water supply have prompted the royal palace to take the matter in hand. OCP boss Mostafa Terrab is tasked with remedying the situation.                             Moulay Hassan's enrolment into the university served as a royal blessing for OCP boss Mostafa Terrab's pride and joy. The institute is on the way to becoming a nursery for the future royal entourage, or Makhzen.             From Monday to Friday at 04:40 GMT.

Read this article here:                  The US president's announcement that the sanctions against Damascus were being lifted marked a sudden shift of his Syrian policy. Behind the scenes, this change of heart appears to have been strongly backed by the Syrian American Alliance for Peace and Prosperity, a pressure group whose interests range from politics to real estate.                             Despite intense US diplomatic pressure, the issues of Syria's Kurds, Russian bases and foreign fighters remain under discussion between all involved parties. Their resolution will inevitably pass via Ankara, much to the chagrin of Tel Aviv, Paris and the Gulf states.                             Across the globe, spies love to gather in inconspicuous dens to meet contacts and hold discreet conversations. This week, Intelligence Online steps aboard an armoury vessel in the Red Sea, a floating home where ex-Gurkha soldiers exchange tips on how to deal with an unprecedented maritime threat.                             From secret visits to high-level videoconferences, French security diplomacy has been finding its way among the major players ahead of a major Syria conference in Paris on 13 February. While Russia is trying to get back into the country, some Gulf nations are readying an alternative to Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.                             Amid an extended hiatus in attacks in the Bab al-Mandab strait, the European shipping community is cautiously hopeful of a return to the region. But there are concerns over what the industry should expect from its armed escort teams.                             The EU's Operation Aspides continues, despite a four-week lull in attacks in the Bab al-Mandab strait. Meanwhile, as the new Gaza ceasefire takes hold, questions are being raised about how the area's most serious attacks could have been prevented.                             Unable to fire its heavy payloads on domestic soil, Saudi Arabia is weighing up a space partnership with Oman, an ideally situated space partner. The UAE faces a similar dilemma.                             By announcing in the press on 6 May that they had arrested several Yemeni agents from an intelligence cell, the Houthi movement's security services relaunched their hunt for supporters of former Yemeni president Ali Abdallah Saleh.                             With military operations ramping up in the Red Sea, Abu Dhabi is keeping a close watch on the archipelago located in the mouth of crucial shipping routes. The UAE armed forces even scanned the entire island from space a few weeks ago.

Read this article here:                  The use of virtual terrain reproductions known as "digital twins" has become decisive on battlefields where GPS signals are jammed. They are now the subject of an intense battle between geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) providers seeking to win contracts with Western militaries.                             An Omani businessman who is already a Thales agent and has strong connections in Muscat is a partner in the major Gulf economic forum organised by France and held in Paris on 17 June. With numerous clients in the sultanate's armed forces and police, his company is also opening Oman's doors to Chinese groups.                             Despite the setbacks to its space programme, Iran is trying to capitalise on the quality of its researchers and academics by offering a broad range of training courses to attract students from BRICS countries.                             The countries making up the organisation had lofty ambitions for cooperation in space, in particular for image sharing. But the first documents issued by Brazil, which is organising the group's next summit on 6 and 7 July, show that for the time being, collaboration is very limited.                             Owing to the war in Ukraine and the intense technology race with China, the US National Reconnaissance Office wants to rely on a long trusted GEOINT operator, thereby closing a political and commercial lull of easier access to high-resolution satellite imagery.

However, the structure and content suggest a focus on business and economic interests, which could imply a centre-left or centre-right perspective but leans more towards a centre or neutral positioning with a focus on business and economic topics.
