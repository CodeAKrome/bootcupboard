right	strong	US President Donald Trump added Wednesday evening US time to his growing list of countries that would face steep tariffs in the coming weeks if they fail to reach trade agreements with the United States, as he threatens to drag nations large and small into his trade war. On his social media account, the President posted form letters informing countries, including the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Moldova, Brunei, Libya, Iraq and Algeria, that they should prepare for double-digit tariff rates. Except for the name of the country and the tariff rate, the letters were identical to those he posted Monday, which targeted 14 nations. Later Wednesday afternoon, Mr Trump issued another threat to impose a 50 per cent tariff on products from Brazil. His letter implied that the higher rate was partly in response to what Mr Trump described as a “witch hunt” against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for attempting a coup. Later that evening, Mr Trump escalated his tariff plans further, saying he would begin imposing a 50 per cent tariff on imported copper as of Aug. 1. The President said he was taking action because copper, which the United States imports from Chile, Canada and other countries, is crucial for national defence. The price of US copper futures has soared since Mr Trump mentioned he was planning a 50 per cent tariff during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday. Brazil and the other trading partners that Mr Trump targeted Wednesday join a growing list of countries that will face additional tariffs Aug 1, including Japan and South Korea. The President’s renewed threats against both large and small trading partners suggests that he is hewing to a global tariff strategy he announced in early April that punishes countries broadly for a variety of trading practices and policies he has deemed unfair. Kimberley Braddish In issuing his threat to Brazil, which was more sharply worded than the previous form letters, Mr Trump cited the country’s “insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans (as lately illustrated by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which has issued hundreds of SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders to US Social Media platforms, threatening them with Millions of Dollars in Fines and Eviction from the Brazilian Social Media market).” As part of his attack, Mr Trump also directed his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, to begin investigating Brazil’s digital trade policies, which could result in further tariffs. This week’s threats essentially seek to replace steep tariffs the President announced in April, when he singled out roughly 60 countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it. He said that those trade imbalances were evidence that foreign countries had long mistreated the United States, an assertion economists have criticised. The President had originally set July 8 as the last day for countries to sign trade deals with the United States to avoid those tariffs. At the urging of some of his advisers, on Monday he pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1. Many countries are racing to try to sign trade deals, including major trading partners like the European Union and India. In April, Peter Navarro, the President’s top trade adviser, promised to sign 90 trade deals in 90 days. But it remains impractical for the United States to negotiate simultaneously with all of the countries the President has threatened with tariffs, something he acknowledged at the White House on Tuesday. “We can’t meet with 200 countries,” he said. Amy Lee Though some investors have doubted whether Mr Trump would follow through with his threats, the President insists that the August 1 deadline will not be delayed further. If that is the case, stiff tariffs will go into effect on imports from dozens of additional countries. The President has also been weighing further tariffs on a variety of critical industries, including copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber. The Administration appears to be finalising these actions, and some of those tariffs could come as early as the next few weeks. In a meeting Wednesday with a group of African leaders at the White House, Mr Trump said that tariffs would be “a great thing for our country.” “We’ve taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, hundreds of billions, and we haven’t even started yet,” he said. He added that the United States “really haven’t had too many complaints because I’m keeping them at a very low number. Very conservative.” Mr Trump’s letters repeatedly mentioned the bilateral trade deficits that the United States runs with other countries, calling them “unsustainable” and “a major threat” to the nation’s economic security. Some economists believe that the overall US trade deficit with the world is problematic, because it means that fewer factories in the US employ Americans. But many economists have criticised the President’s focus on the trade deficits with individual countries as a measure for US trading relationships. Economists argue that bilateral deficits with various countries occur for all kinds of reasons. The most important is simply that foreign countries may specialise in producing certain products that Americans prefer to buy — cars, gold, chocolate — which is not something a foreign government can or would want to control. It also seems unlikely that the United States could eliminate these trade deficits by encouraging foreign countries to buy American products. While such sales could help to partly balance trade and benefit US exporters, there’s little reason to think other countries would buy the same amount of products that the United States, often the wealthier country, demands from the rest of the world. For example, the President has said that a trade deal between the United States and Vietnam would open Vietnamese markets and lead to sales of American vehicles. “It is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social last week. But analysts have pointed out that Vietnamese streets are much tinier than American ones, and the per capita annual income in Vietnam is only $4,000, about a tenth of the cost of a midsize SUV.

Ms Albanese, a human rights lawyer, serves as the UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, an independent position tasked with investigating and reporting on human rights conditions in the region. She has been highly critical of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, frequently referring to the ongoing war as a “genocide”.

Kimberley Braddish This week, Ms Albanese has campaigned for Italy, France and Greece to close their airspace as Mr Netanyahu flew to the US, noting his outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Mr Rubio said Ms Albanese would be sanctioned for her “biased and malicious activities”. “Albanese has spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West,” he said in a new statement. “That bias has been apparent across the span of her career, including recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.” “She has recently escalated this effort by writing threatening letters to dozens of entities worldwide, including major American companies across finance, technology, defence, energy, and hospitality, making extreme and unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC pursue investigations and prosecutions of these companies and their executives.” “We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty.” The Trump Administration had previously sanctioned International Criminal Court judges and prosecutors, including British lawyer Karim Khan, who issued the initial arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu.

Mr Trump’s announcement came as Politico reported that more than 2,100 senior-ranking Nasa employees are set to leave their jobs under a push by the administration to shed staff through early retirement, buyouts and deferred resignations. Under Mr Trump’s administration, the US space industry and Nasa’s workforce of 18,000 have been whipsawed by looming layoffs and proposed budget cuts that would cancel dozens of science programmes.

PHOTO: REUTERS Published Jul 10, 2025, 09:42 AM Updated Jul 10, 2025, 10:35 AM WASHINGTON – US President Donald Trump announced on July 9 a new 50 per cent tariff on copper, effective Aug 1, in a bid to promote domestic development of an industry critical to defence, electronics and automobiles.  The move marks the latest in a string of sectoral tariffs Mr Trump has placed on industries such as steel and aluminium that economists warn will drive up costs for American consumers. The US president signalled on July 8 that he was imposing fresh tariffs on copper, sending US Comex copper futures to record highs.  The White House ordered a Section 232 investigation into copper imports in February, using a law that gives the president authority to impose higher tariffs based on national security grounds. Section 232 investigation into copper imports in February, Mr Trump said on July 9 that he received a "robust" national security assessment, which concluded that tariffs were necessary to protect US production of a commodity that is critical across an array of industries.  "Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centres, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defence Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many," Mr Trump said in a post on Truth Social.  The US depends on imports for nearly half of its refined copper needs, and brought in 810,000 metric tons in 2024, according to the US Geological Survey. Countries set to be most affected by the tariff are Chile, Canada and Mexico, which were the top suppliers of refined copper, copper alloys and copper products to the US in 2024, according to the country’s Census Bureau data. Chile, Canada and Peru have told the administration that imports from their countries do not threaten US interests and should not face tariffs. All three have free trade deals with the US. The steep tariff is designed to encourage production in the US. More than two-thirds of the country's copper is mined in Arizona, where the development of a massive new mine planned by Rio Tinto and BHP has been stalled for more than a decade.

PHOTOS: REUTERS, AL DRAGO/NYTIMES Published Jul 10, 2025, 06:40 AM Updated Jul 10, 2025, 06:40 AM WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on July 9 accused former FBI director James Comey and ex-CIA chief John Brennan, two prominent critics under criminal investigation, of being “crooked” and said they may have to “pay a price”. Asked on July 9 about the FBI’s opening of a probe into Mr Comey and Mr Brennan, Mr Trump said he knows “nothing about it other than what I read today”. “But I will tell you I think they’re very dishonest people,” the president told reporters at the White House. “I think they’re crooked as hell and maybe they have to pay a price for that.” Fox News Digital first reported the probe into Mr Comey and Mr Brennan, saying it involved “potential wrongdoing” related to the investigation into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election won by Mr Trump, and alleged false statements made to Congress. CIA director John Ratcliffe, a Trump appointee, had referred “evidence of wrongdoing by Brennan” to FBI director Kash Patel, another Trump appointee, for potential prosecution, Fox News Digital said, citing Justice Department sources. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the agency does “not comment on ongoing investigations”. Mr Comey and Mr Brennan were named to their respective positions as head of the FBI and CIA by Democratic president Barack Obama, and they have a contentious history with Mr Trump dating back to his first term in the White House. Mr Trump fired Mr Comey in 2017 as the FBI chief was leading a probe into whether any members of the Trump campaign had colluded with Moscow to sway the 2016 presidential vote between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump fired Mr Comey in 2017 That investigation, which Mr Trump has denounced for years as the “Russia hoax”, was taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller, who found there had been interference by Russia in the 2016 election in favour of Mr Trump. But Mr Mueller said the probe “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities”. Mr Trump revoked Mr Brennan’s security clearance in 2018, accusing the former CIA chief of making “unfounded and outrageous allegations” about his administration. Since taking office in January, Mr Trump has taken a number of punitive measures against his perceived enemies, stripping former officials of their security clearances and protective details, targeting law firms involved in past cases against him and pulling federal funding from universities.

In a letter, Mr Trump linked the tariffs to Brazil's treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro who is on trial over charges of plotting a coup. former President Jair Bolsonaro who is on trial over charges of plotting a coup.

"If he thinks he can impose tariffs, other countries have the right to impose tariffs too." Tensions between the United States and Brazil had already been intensifying on July 9 after Brazil's foreign ministry summoned the US Embassy's chargé d'affaires over a statement defending Mr Bolsonaro. Around the same time, Mr Trump, speaking to reporters at an event with West African leaders at the White House, said Brazil "has not been good to us, not good at all", adding that the tariff rates would be based on "very, very substantial facts" and past history. The US Embassy in Brasilia confirmed on July 9 that Mr Gabriel Escobar, its chargé d'affaires, had a meeting with officials from Brazil’s foreign ministry, though it declined to share details about the conversation.

The move is the latest in a series of actions the administration has taken against Harvard, which sued the federal government after officials terminated billions of dollars in grants awarded to the school and moved to bar it from admitting international students. terminated billions of dollars in grants The administration has said it is trying to force change at Harvard and other top-level universities across the US, contending they have become bastions of leftist "woke" thought and anti-Semitism. Mr Trump said on June 20 that talks with Harvard that could soon produce a settlement were under way. He told reporters at the White House on July 9 that he remained optimistic about the prospect of a settlement and that “they’ll absolutely reach a deal.” “Harvard’s been very bad - totally anti-Semitic,” he said. But as of the morning of July 9, when the latest actions by the administration were announced, talks had stalled, and the parties were “far from an agreement,” a person familiar with the matter said. “Harvard remains unwavering in its efforts to protect its community and its core principles against unfounded retribution by the federal government,” Harvard said in a statement. The US Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services said on July 9 that they formally notified Harvard’s accreditor, the New England Commission of Higher Education, that Harvard had violated a federal anti-discrimination law by failing to protect Jewish and Israeli students on campus. The agencies said there was “strong evidence to suggest the school may no longer meet the commission’s accreditation standards,” after the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Civil Rights last month concluded that Harvard had violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a statement said her agency expects the commission to “keep the department fully informed of its efforts to ensure that Harvard is in compliance with federal law and accreditor standards.” The commission, a nonprofit accreditor, is not slated to comprehensively evaluate Harvard again until mid-2027. It confirmed it received a letter from the departments and said the federal government cannot direct it to revoke a school’s accreditation and that a university found to run afoul of its standards can have up to four years to come into compliance. The departments’ announcement came shortly after the Homeland Security Department said it would issue administrative subpoenas seeking records concerning the “criminality and misconduct” of student visa holders on Harvard’s campus. administrative subpoenas seeking records Harvard argues the Trump administration is retaliating against it and trampling on its free-speech rights under the US Constitution’s First Amendment after it refused to meet the Trump administration’s demands to cede control over the school’s curriculum and admissions. It also says it has been unfairly targeted based on what officials view as the university’s left-leaning orientation. A federal judge in June blocked the administration from implementing a proclamation Mr Trump signed that sought to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. bar foreign nationals from entering the United States The administration has appealed that ruling, and the Homeland Security Department is pursuing through an administrative process a possible revocation of Harvard’s ability to enroll international students.

Police clashed with protesters on the outskirts of the city and in 17 of 47 counties across the country, leaving 31 people dead and more than 100 injured. More than 500 others were arrested. A total of 50 people have died in the past two weeks during two separate waves of demonstrations. The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, on Tuesday urged that the grievances leading to the protests are addressed. Ruto on Wednesday claimed the discontent was politically motivated and said that he would not allow destruction of property. “You can call me whatever names you want to call me, but I will make sure there is peace and stability in Kenya, by all means,” Ruto said. The president read a riot act to his political rivals who he said wanted to overthrow his government through violence. "This country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and who want to have a change of government using unconstitutional means. It is not going to happen," Ruto said. Civil society groups have repeatedly called for restraint by police during demonstrations. Five police officers were recently charged in court over the death of a blogger in custody and the close-range shooting of a civilian. The deputy police inspector general Eliud Langat, who had filed a complaint about the blogger’s social media posts accusing him of corruption, has since stepped aside as investigations continue. 	The article presents a clear narrative that supports government intervention and suppresses dissent, framing President Ruto's actions as necessary to maintain order and stability. It portrays protesters as violent and lawless, while emphasizing the need for peace and stability. The piece does not provide substantial counter-narratives or perspectives from protesters or critics of the government's actions, suggesting a bias towards those in power.

Minister of State Yalo donated almost a quarter of that sum.                             Against a backdrop of political and personal tensions, the two men were arrested in Bangui and remain behind bars. The businessman Sani Yalo, who is close to President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, appears to be the éminence grise in the matter.                             Héritier Doneng, who is close to Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadéra, pulled a media stunt by trying to impose Rigobert Song as the national football team coach. But he was forced to back down after the country's soccer federation and FIFA opposed the move.                             President Faustin-Archange Touadéra is expected to be nominated at the MOUNI congress on 28 December as the movement's candidate for the 2025-2026 presidential election.

right	strong	Kemi Badenoch will call for foreign nationals to be barred from claiming disability and sickness benefits, as she sets out plans for tighter curbs on welfare. In a speech on Thursday, the Tory leader will describe Britain's benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb" that could "collapse the economy". It comes after the party outlined some of its own proposals to reduce spending, after Labour largely gutted its own plan for benefits cuts after a backbench revolt. Legislation to bring in remaining government cuts to sickness benefits was approved by MPs on Wednesday evening.  But other proposals, including changes to the eligibility criteria for disability benefits, have effectively been put on hold. The government announced plans to shrink welfare spending in March, warning the working-age welfare bill was set to rise by nearly £30bn by 2030 and reforms to the system were required to ensure it remained sustainable. It wanted to make it harder to claim personal independence payment (Pip), the main disability benefit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and make health-related top-ups for universal credit less generous.  But ministers significantly watered down the cuts earlier this month after a huge rebellion from Labour MPs, all but wiping out savings estimated to be worth £5bn a year by the end of the decade.  Plans to freeze the higher rate of universal credit for existing health-related claimants have been reversed, whilst all changes to the Pip system have been parked pending a government review into the assessment regime. In her speech on Thursday, Badenoch will accuse Labour of being "beholden to left-wing MPs" and "turning a blind eye" to rising benefit costs. She will also seek to create a dividing line with Reform UK over the two-child benefit cap, which Nigel Farage's party has pledged to scrap, branding him "Jeremy Corbyn with a pint and a cigarette". "On welfare he shows his true colours - promising unaffordable giveaways with no plan to fix the system," she is expected to add. A Labour spokesperson said "The Conservatives had 14 years to reform welfare - instead, they left the country with a broken system that holds people back and fails to support the most vulnerable." The party also warned that the Conservative proposal could see disabled British nationals living abroad being denied support if other countries decided to take a similar approach.  The Conservatives have not backed the government's legislation to deliver the changes, arguing its proposals do not go far enough. They have set out some plans of their own to shrink welfare spending in the form of amendments to the government's plans, which were defeated on Wednesday. These include limiting access to Pips and the health-related part of universal credit to those with "less severe" mental health conditions, and preventing claimants from receiving payments without a face-to-face assessment. They also say both benefits should only be paid to British citizens, with exceptions for those covered by international agreements, such as citizens from EU countries who have acquired settled status in the UK. At the moment, foreign nationals gain access to the welfare system when they are granted indefinite leave to remain or refugee status. Applicants for Pip generally need to have lived in Britain for at least two of the last three years. Asylum seekers are not allowed to apply for benefits, although they have access to taxpayer-funded accommodation and separate financial support. Conservative shadow minister Neil O'Brien has said he has obtained figures under freedom of information laws showing universal credit payments to households containing at least one foreign national stood at £941m a month as of March. But working out the exact scale of payments to non-UK nationals specifically is complicated, because the Department for Work and Pensions does not provide a breakdown of claimants by immigration status and nationality. However, the department is due to publish the first such breakdown next week, and has committed to updates every three months thereafter.

right	strong	LUGANSK, July 10. /TASS/. Russian troops effectively advanced near Seversk in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the past few days, with less than 1 km to go to reach its outskirts, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS. "Over the past few days, Russian forces conducted a successful maneuver and took hold of two tree lines north of Chubarovsky Pond, located east of Seversk in the DPR. As a result of the breakthrough, the distance to the town in one sector of the front line was reduced to 900 meters," he said. According to Marochko, the fiercest fighting is currently taking place near the town. Kiev is racing to build up its troops near Seversk to stabilize the situation, he added.	The article demonstrates a strong right bias through its one-sided portrayal of Russian military advancements and its framing of Ukrainian actions as reactive. The use of terms like 'successful maneuver' and 'fiercest fighting' suggests a perspective that is sympathetic to the Russian side, which is characteristic of a right-leaning bias in this context.
right	strong	MOSCOW, July 10. /TASS/. Soldiers from the 114th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Battlegroup Center have unfurled Russian and unit flags over the liberated settlement of Dachnoye in the Dnepropetrovsk Region, the Defense Ministry announced, releasing footage of the moment. "We liberated [Dachnoye]. The command dropped two flags to us via a bird (meaning a drone - TASS)," explained Ilvir Davletgareyev, a unit commander. "A 114th Brigade flag and our Russian flag. Of course, I am proud. It was the first time I stretched the flag . We carried out a combat mission. We showed that the village had been cleared. Russian troops are there. We are proud now," he added. On July 7, 2025, the Russian Defense Ministry officially reported the liberation of Dachnoye.	The article strongly supports the Russian military's actions, using phrases like 'liberated' and 'proud' to describe the occupation of Dachnoye. The language employed is assertive and nationalistic, emphasizing Russian control and pride, which aligns with a right-leaning perspective that often prioritizes national sovereignty and military strength.
right	strong	WASHINGTON, July 10. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has announced the introduction of a 50% duty on copper imports to the United States, according to a post on his Truth Social page. "I am announcing a 50% tariff on copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust national security assessment," Trump pointed out. He noted that the US needs copper to manufacture semiconductors, aircraft, ships, ammunition, batteries, radar systems, missile defense systems, hypersonic weapons, and to construct data centers. "Copper is the second most used material," the US leader stressed. Meanwhile, he shared a view that by imposing a duty on copper imports, he would correct the mistakes made by the previous US administration of Joe Biden, accusing the former president of "thoughtless behavior and stupidity.".	The article demonstrates a strong right bias through its portrayal of President Trump's announcement of a 50% tariff on copper imports, framing it as a necessary measure for national security and economic protection. The language used emphasizes Trump's proactive stance, while also criticizing the previous administration and aligning with right-leaning views on economic nationalism and protectionism.
right	strong	WASHINGTON, July 10. /TASS/. The United States has decided to impose 50% customs duties on imports of goods from Brazil starting August 1, US President Donald Trump announced. He published on his Truth Social page the text of a message addressed to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, outlining the new tariff level. Trump warned that if Brasilia decides to introduce retaliatory tariffs, the US will raise its tax rate on Brazilian goods further — by the same amount that Brasilia sets. In addition, according to Trump, US trade negotiator Jamieson Greer will immediately launch an investigation into Brazil’s practices in bilateral trade with the US. As a result of this proceeding, Brasilia could face additional increases in US import duties.	The article presents a policy action by a Republican U.S. President, Donald Trump, that could be seen as protecting American interests through tariffs, a common right-leaning approach. The context provided focuses on economic nationalism and potential retaliatory measures against Brazil, aligning with typical conservative stances on trade.
right	strong	GENEVA, July 10. /TASS/. The deaths of civilians in the Gaza Strip are a tragic consequence of Hamas’s actions, Israel’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, told reporters. "We do not want to see civilians being hurt, being killed. Hamas brought it upon their own people. It’s a tragedy. It’s a terrible tragedy," Meron emphasized, underscoring Israel’s stance that the radical Palestinian group bears responsibility for the ongoing bloodshed. Meron also highlighted Israel’s current diplomatic efforts, noting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington seeking a path to de-escalation. "So, let’s hope and pray that there will be a soon ceasefire, and we can work towards a better situation very soon," he added. Meanwhile, negotiations aimed at halting the fighting have resumed in Doha. Mediated by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, the renewed talks between Hamas and Israel began on July 6 in a bid to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Sources cited by Al Arabiya described the atmosphere of the discussions as "positive," though breakthroughs remain elusive. According to Reuters, one major obstacle is Israel’s refusal to allow unrestricted, safe delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza — a sticking point that continues to stall progress.	The article presents a viewpoint that aligns with Israel's perspective, emphasizing Hamas's responsibility for civilian casualties and highlighting Israel's diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire. The language used underscores Israel's actions as justified and frames Hamas negatively, which is indicative of a right-leaning bias.
right	strong	GENEVA, July 10. /TASS/. Israel is not committing genocide, and the figures alleging that the number of victims in the Gaza Strip is approaching 60,000 are misleading, Israel’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, told reporters. "Number one, Israel is not committing a genocide anywhere. We are not a genocidal country. . Number two, the figures that you quoted, I refute," he said in response to a journalist’s question about Israel’s moral authority as the number of alleged genocide victims in the Palestinian enclave approaches 60,000. The discussion took place during a meeting on a report by independent Israeli experts regarding sexualized violence committed by the Palestinian group Hamas against victims of the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, as well as against Israeli hostages held by the militants. The report, based on the testimony of 15 released hostages and 17 eyewitnesses, is part of a project called Dinah. Its authors aim to hold accountable those responsible for the October 7 crimes, which they describe as part of a genocide campaign. According to the latest figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 57,500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 136,900 wounded in the fighting in Gaza. The Times of Israel reports that Hamas is still holding 49 of the 251 Israeli hostages abducted on October 7, 2023. The Israeli government believes that 20 of them are still alive, while the condition of two others is a matter of grave concern. The publication notes that Hamas has released 140 hostages since the start of the conflict. The Israeli military has rescued eight hostages and recovered the bodies of 49 others in Gaza.	The article presents a clear defense of Israel's actions and directly challenges the narrative of genocide, which aligns with right-leaning perspectives that often emphasize national sovereignty and security. The language used by Israel's representative to refute allegations and downplay numbers suggests a strong bias towards minimizing criticism of Israel's actions in the conflict.
right	strong	BUDAPEST, July 9. /TASS/. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says that the corruption accusations against European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are only the "tip of the iceberg" of where the EU has gone wrong under her leadership. "Tomorrow will be a turbulent day for the European Parliament," Orban noted, referring to the July 10 confidence vote on von der Leyen’s leadership in Strasbourg. "Members of the European Parliament will decide whether she should remain in her role as the head of Brussels’ bureaucracy. While the vote has to do with a series of corruption scandals surrounding the president, we all know corruption is just the tip of the iceberg," he wrote on the social media platform X. "That is not the only thing this is about. This is also about competence, results and Europe’s future," the Hungarian prime minister added, calling current EU policies a failure on all fronts. In his view, European competitiveness is collapsing, energy prices are skyrocketing, illegal immigration is out of control, gender ideology is thriving, the Ukraine conflict is dragging on, European farmers are facing bankruptcy, while the "senseless green ideology has run amok." "Tomorrow will be the moment of truth: Brussels’ imperial elite versus patriots with common sense. There is no escaping it - a choice must be made. Madame President, leadership means responsibility. Time to go!" Orban stressed, calling on von der Leyen to resign. The confidence vote on von der Leyen’s leadership in the European Parliament follows allegations of misconduct in the EU’s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines which turned out to not have passed clinical trials.	The article demonstrates a strong right bias through its critical portrayal of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU's leadership. The language used by Viktor Orban, as reported, frames the EU's policies as failures and criticizes von der Leyen's competence. The article emphasizes Orban's call for change and accountability, reflecting a right-leaning perspective that prioritizes national sovereignty and criticizes EU bureaucracy.
