The Russian Armed Forces are carrying out required operational and combat measures on the territory of the Voronezh Region as part of a counter-terror operation.
"I will keep informing you about the latest developments," the governor said on his Telegram channel.
A counter-terror regime was introduced in Moscow, the Moscow and Voronezh Regions earlier on Saturday.
The Telegram channel of Wagner private military company founder Yevgeny Prigozhin earlier posted several audio records with accusations against the country\u2019s military leaders.
