# Sure, here's a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the `curses` library:
# ```python
import curses
import secrets

s = curses.initscr()
curses.curs_set(0)
sh, sw = s.getmaxyx()
w = curses.newwin(sh, sw, 0, 0)
w.keypad(1)
w.timeout(100)

snk_x = sw//4
snk_y = sh//2
snake = [
    [snk_y, snk_x],
    [snk_y, snk_x-1],
    [snk_y, snk_x-2]
]

food = [sh//2, sw//2]
w.addch(int(food[0]), int(food[1]), curses.ACS_PI)

key = curses.KEY_RIGHT

while True:
    next_key = w.getch()
    key = key if next_key == -1 else next_key

    if snake[0][0] in [0, sh] or \
        snake[0][1]  in [0, sw] or \
        snake[0] in snake[1:]:
        curses.endwin()
        quit()

    new_head = [snake[0][0], snake[0][1]]

    if key == curses.KEY_DOWN:
        new_head[0] += 1
    if key == curses.KEY_UP:
        new_head[0] -= 1
    if key == curses.KEY_LEFT:
        new_head[1] -= 1
    if key == curses.KEY_RIGHT:
        new_head[1] += 1

    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    if snake[0] == food:
        food = None
        while food is None:
            nf = [
                secrets.SystemRandom().randint(1, sh-1),
                secrets.SystemRandom().randint(1, sw-1)
            ]
            food = nf if nf not in snake else None
        w.addch(food[0], food[1], curses.ACS_PI)
    else:
        tail = snake.pop()
        w.addch(int(tail[0]), int(tail[1]), ' ')

    w.addch(int(snake[0][0]), int(snake[0][1]), curses.ACS_CKBOARD)
# ```
# This code creates a simple Snake game where the player controls the snake using the arrow keys and tries to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body. The game ends when either of those conditions is met. The `curses` library is used for creating a text-based user interface, and it allows us to create a simple game like this one.

# Note that this code assumes that you have the `curses` library installed on your system. If you don't, you can install it using pip:
# ```
# pip install windows-curses (for Windows)
# pip install curses (for Linux and macOS)
# ```
# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
