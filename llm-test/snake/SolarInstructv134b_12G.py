To write the classic Snake game using Python, follow these steps:

1. Install necessary libraries: To create a graphical user interface for our Snake game, we will use PyGame (pip install pygame). This library allows us to handle events, draw shapes, and manage images on the screen.

2. Create a basic structure: Start by creating a new Python file with the standard boilerplate code. Define the constants, such as window dimensions, frame rate, colors used for backgrounds and shapes, etc.

3. Initialize PyGame: In your main function, initialize PyGame by setting up a display (screen), mouse, and keyboard event listeners. Also create an event queue (pygame.event.get) to manage events occurring on the screen.

4. Game Loop: Create a while loop with conditions for quitting the game (e.g., user presses 'q' or reaches the end of the level). The main logic of the Snake game will run within this loop.

5. Draw the Screen: Within the game loop, update the screen by filling it with background color and drawing the elements such as the snake, fruit (which serves as food), score, and level indicator. Use PyGame's surface objects to draw rectangles for the body segments, a circle for the fruit, and text for the score and level.

6. Game Logic: Implement the game logic within the main loop. Move the snake according to user inputs (keys pressed). Check for collisions between the head of the snake and its own body, walls, or the fruit. When the snake eats the fruit, increase the score, generate a new fruit in a random position, and increment the level.

7. Game End Conditions: Define when to end the game based on conditions such as reaching the end of the level or colliding with itself or the walls. Display a "Game Over" screen and provide an option for restarting the game.

8. Test & Debug: Run the code, test its functionality, and fix any bugs that arise. Make sure you can control the snake using arrow keys or WASD, and observe how the snake grows, eats food, and eventually ends when it collides with itself, walls, or reaches the end of a level.

By following these steps, you should have a functional version of Snake written in Python using PyGame as a GUI library.
