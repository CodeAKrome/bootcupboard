write a streamlit app that displays a list of large language models (llms) that ollama has downloaded and allows you to select which models you would like to use. This should include an option for all. Provide inputs for all ollama arguments in the call including a large text box for prompt and system message input. Add a Generate button that submits the information to ollama and displays its response in a separate text box with the ability to copy any text box content by clicking a button near the box.
