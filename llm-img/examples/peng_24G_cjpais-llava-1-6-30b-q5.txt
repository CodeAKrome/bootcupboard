Their black and white plumage contrasts with the bright white snow, making them stand out in the scene.

The image is likely intended to capture the natural behavior and habitat of these animals, showcasing their ability to survive in harsh conditions. The presence of icebergs and mountains indicates that this location is remote and possibly a protected area for wildlife conservation.
